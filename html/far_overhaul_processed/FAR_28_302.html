<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_28_302__d1855e8">When the Government requires the contractor to provide insurance coverage, the policies must contain an endorsement that any cancellation or material change in the coverage adversely affecting the Government’s interest must not be effective unless the insurer or the contractor gives written notice of cancellation or change as required by the contracting officer. When the coverage is provided by self-insurance, the contractor must not change or decrease the coverage without the administrative contracting officer’s prior approval (see 28.308(c)).</p></div>
