        <p class="p" id="FAR_52_228_4__d3460e8">As prescribed in<span class="ph ClauseProvisionXREF">  28.309(b)</span>, insert the following clause:</p>
        <p class="p Ctr_SmCaps" id="FAR_52_228_4__d3460e15">Workers’ Compensation and War-Hazard Insurance Overseas<span class="ph SmCaps">(Apr 1984)</span> </p>
        <p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_228_4__d3460e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> 						 This paragraph applies if the Contractor employs any person who, but for a waiver granted by the Secretary of Labor, would be subject to workers’ compensation insurance under the Defense Base Act (<a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section1651&num=0&edition=prelim" target="_blank">42 U.S.C.1651</a>, <em class="ph i">etseq</em>.). On behalf of employees for whom the applicability of the Defense Base Act has been waived, the Contractor shall (1) provide, before commencing performance under this contract, at least that workers’ compensation insurance or the equivalent as the laws of the country of which these employees are nationals may require, and (2) continue to maintain it until performance is completed. The Contractor shall insert, in all subcontracts under this contract to which the Defense Base Act would apply but for the waiver, a clause similar to this paragraph (a) (including this sentence) imposing upon those subcontractors this requirement to provide such workers’ compensation insurance coverage.</p>
        <p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_228_4__d3460e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> 						 This paragraph applies if the Contractor or any subcontractor under this contract employs any person who, but for a waiver granted by the Secretary of Labor, would be subject to the War Hazards Compensation Act (<a class="xref" href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title42-section1701&num=0&edition=prelim" target="_blank">42 U.S.C.1701</a>, <em class="ph i">etseq</em>.). On behalf of employees for whom the applicability of the Defense Base Act (and hence that of the War Hazards Compensation Act) has been waived, the Contractor shall, subject to reimbursement as provided elsewhere in this contract, afford the same protection as that provided in the War Hazards Compensation Act, except that the level of benefits shall conform to any law or international agreement controlling the benefits to which the employees may be entitled. In all other respects, the standards of the War Hazards Compensation Act shall apply; <em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> the definition of war-hazard risks (injury, death, capture, or detention as the result of a war hazard as defined in the Act), proof of loss, and exclusion of benefits otherwise covered by workers’ compensation insurance or the equivalent. Unless the Contractor elects to assume directly the liability to subcontractor employees created by this clause, the Contractor shall insert, in all subcontracts under this contract to which the War Hazards Compensation Act would apply but for the waiver, a clause similar to this paragraph (b) (including this sentence) imposing upon those subcontractors this requirement to provide war-hazard benefits.</p>
