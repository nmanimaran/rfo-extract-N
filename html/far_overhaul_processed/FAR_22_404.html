<div class="body conbody"><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must furnish to the contractor, Department of Labor Form WH-1321, Notice to Employees Working on Federal and Federally Financed Construction Projects, for posting with the wage rates. The name, address, and telephone number of the Government officer responsible for the administration of the contract must be indicated in the poster to inform workers to whom they may submit complaints or raise questions concerning labor standards.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> In accordance with the requirements of the clause at 52.222-11, Subcontracts (Labor Standards), the contractor and subcontractors at any tier are required to submit a fully executed SF 1413, Statement and Acknowledgment, upon award of each subcontract.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Before construction begins, the contracting officer must inform the contractor of the labor standards clauses and wage determination requirements of the contract and of the contractor's and any subcontractor's responsibilities under the contract. Unless it is clear that the contractor is fully aware of the requirements, the contracting officer must issue an explanatory letter and/or arrange a conference with the contractor promptly after award of the contract.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If contract award is made without the required wage determination (i.e., incorporating no determination, containing a clearly inapplicable general wage determination, or containing a project determination which is inapplicable because of an inaccurate description of the project or its location), the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Modify the contract to incorporate the required wage determination (retroactive to the date of award), and equitably adjust the contract price if appropriate; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Terminate the contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If a required wage determination (valid determination in effect on the date of award) is not available, the contracting officer must expeditiously request a wage determination from the Department of Labor, including a statement explaining the circumstances and giving the date of the contract award.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> If any laborer or mechanic is to be employed in a classification that is not listed in the wage determination applicable to the contract, the contracting officer, pursuant to the clause at 52.222-6, Construction Wage Rate Requirements, must require that the contractor submit to the contracting officer, Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request for Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, which, along with other pertinent data, contains the proposed additional classification and minimum wage rate including any fringe benefits payments.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Upon receipt of SF 1444 from the contractor, the contracting officer must review the request to determine whether it meets the following criteria:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The classification is appropriate and the work to be performed by the classification is not performed by any classification contained in the applicable wage determination.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The proposed wage rate, including any fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates in the wage determination in the contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the criteria in paragraph (d)(1) of this section are met and the contractor and the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the additional classification (if known) or their representatives agree to the proposed additional classification, and the contracting officer approves, the contracting officer must submit a report (including a copy of SF 1444) of that action to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, for approval, modification, or disapproval of the additional classification and wage rate (including any amount designated for fringe benefits); or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If the contractor, the laborers or mechanics to be employed in the classification or their representatives, and the contracting officer do not agree on the proposed additional classification, or if the criteria are not met, the contracting officer must submit a report (including a copy of SF 1444) giving the views of all interested parties and the contracting officer's recommendation to the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, for determination of appropriate classification and wage rate.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Within 30 days of receipt of the information, the Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, will complete action and so advise the contracting officer, or will notify the contracting officer that additional time is necessary.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Upon receipt of the Department of Labor's action, the contracting officer must forward a copy of the action to the contractor, directing that the classification and wage rate be posted in accordance with paragraph (a) of the clause at 52.222-6 and that workers in the affected classification receive no less than the minimum rate indicated from the first day on which work under the contract was performed in the classification.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> In each option to extend the term of the contract, if any laborer or mechanic is to be employed during the option in a classification that is not listed (or no longer listed) on the wage determination incorporated in that option, the contracting officer must require that the contractor submit a request for conformance using the procedures noted in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must examine the payrolls and payroll statements submitted in accordance with the clause at 52.222-8, to ensure compliance with the contract requirements. The contracting agency must retain payrolls and statements of compliance for 3 years after completion of the contract and make them available when requested by the Department of Labor at any time during that period. Submitted payrolls must not be returned to a contractor or subcontractor for any reasons, but copies thereof may be furnished to the contractor or subcontractor who submitted them, or to a higher tier contractor or subcontractor. Particular attention should be given to-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The correctness of classifications and rates;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Fringe benefits payments;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Hours worked;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Deductions; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Disproportionate employment ratios of laborers, apprentices, or trainees, to journeyman.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contractor payroll records in the Government's possession must be carefully protected from any public disclosure which is not required by law, since payroll records may contain information in which the contractor's employees have a privacy interest, as well as information in which the contractor may have a proprietary interest that the Government may be obliged to protect. Questions concerning release of this information may involve the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer must review the contractor's employment and payment records of apprentices and trainees made available pursuant to the clause at 52.222-8, Payrolls and Basic Records, to ensure that the contractor has complied with the clause at 52.222-9, Apprentices and Trainees.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If a contractor has classified employees as apprentices or trainees without complying with the requirements of the clause at 52.222-9, the contracting officer must reject the classification and require the contractor to pay the affected employees at the rates applicable to the classification of the work actually performed.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> For purposes of the clause at 52.222-6, if the interested parties (i.e. contractor, contracting officer, and employees or their representative) cannot agree on the “cash equivalent,” the contracting officer must submit the question for final determination to the Department of Labor as prescribed by agency procedures. The information submitted must include—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A comparison of the payments, contributions, or costs in the wage determination with those made or proposed as equivalents by the contractor; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The comments and recommendations of the contracting officer</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(h)</span> The following applies when modifying a contract to exercise an option to extend the term of a contract:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Each time the contracting officer exercises an option to extend the term of a contract for construction, or a contract that includes substantial and segregable construction work, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the most current wage determination.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A modified wage determination is effective if—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting agency receives a written action from the Department of Labor prior to exercise of the option, or within 45 days after submission of a wage determination request whichever is later; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The Department of Labor publishes the modification to a general wage determination on the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> before exercise of the option.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If the contracting officer receives an effective modified wage determination either before or after execution of the contract modification to exercise the option, the contracting officer must modify the contract to incorporate the modified wage determination, and any changed wage rates, effective as of the date that the option to extend was effective.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The contracting officer must select the most current wage determination(s) from the same schedule(s) as the wage determination(s) incorporated into the contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> If a contract with an option to extend the term of the contract has indefinite-delivery or indefinite-quantity construction requirements, the contracting officer must incorporate the wage determination incorporated into the contract at the exercise of the option into task orders issued during that option period. The wage determination will be effective for the complete period of performance of those task orders without further revision.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> The contracting officer must include in fixed-price contracts a clause that specifies one of the following methods, suitable to the interest of the Government, to provide an allowance for any increases or decreases in labor costs that result from the inclusion of the current wage determination at the exercise of an option to extend the term of the contract:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer may provide the offerors the opportunity to bid or propose separate prices for each option period. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is used in construction-only contracts (with options to extend the term) that are not expected to exceed a total of 3 years.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The contracting officer may include in the contract a separately specified pricing method that permits an adjustment to the contract price or contract labor unit price at the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract. At the time of option exercise, the contracting officer must incorporate a new wage determination into the contract, and must apply the specific pricing method to calculate the contract price adjustment. An example of a contract pricing method that the contracting officer might separately specify is incorporation in the solicitation and resulting contract of the pricing data from an annually published unit pricing book (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, the U.S. Army Computer-Aided Cost Estimating System or similar commercial product), which is multiplied in the contract by a factor proposed by the contractor (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, .95 or 1.1). At option exercise, the contracting officer incorporates the pricing data from the latest annual edition of the unit pricing book, multiplied by the factor agreed to in the basic contract. The contracting officer must not further adjust the contract price as a result of the incorporation of the new or revised wage determination.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The contracting officer may provide for a contract price adjustment based solely on a percentage rate determined by the contracting officer using a published economic indicator incorporated into the solicitation and resulting contract. At the exercise of each option to extend the term of the contract, the contracting officer will apply the percentage rate, based on the economic indicator, to the portion of the contract price or contract unit price designated in the contract clause as labor costs subject to the provisions of the Construction Wage Rate Requirements statute. The contracting officer must insert 50 percent as the estimated portion of the contract price that is labor unless the contracting officer determines, prior to issuance of the solicitation, that a different percentage is more appropriate for a particular contract or requirement. This percentage adjustment to the designated labor costs must be the only adjustment made to cover increases in wages and/or benefits resulting from the incorporation of a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The contracting officer may provide a computation method to adjust the contract price to reflect the contractor's actual increase or decrease in wages and fringe benefits (combined) to the extent that the increase is made to comply with, or the decrease is voluntarily made by the contractor as a result of incorporation of, a new or revised wage determination at the exercise of the option to extend the term of the contract. Generally, this method is appropriate for use only if contract requirements are predominately services subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and the construction requirements are substantial and segregable. The methods used to adjust the contract price for the service requirements and the construction requirements would be similar.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For appealing a denial of reconsideration of a wage determination see 22.402-3(e).</p></div>
