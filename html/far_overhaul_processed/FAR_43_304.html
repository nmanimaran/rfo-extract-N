<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_43_304__d2595e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Change order documentation.</em> Documentation of unilaterally issued change orders that are later definitized through a bilateral supplement agreement contract modification requires two documents: the initial SF-30 change order and then the subsequent SF-30 supplemental agreement reflecting the resulting equitable adjustment in contract terms. If an equitable adjustment in the contract price or delivery terms or both can be agreed upon in advance, only a bilateral supplemental agreement contract modification (SF-30) need be issued. Administrative changes and change orders issued pursuant to a clause giving the Government a unilateral right to make a change (e.g., an option clause) require only the unilateral SF-30 change order.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_43_304__d2595e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Definitization.</em></p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2" id="FAR_43_304__d2595e26"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3" id="FAR_43_304__d2597e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Contracting officers shall negotiate equitable adjustments resulting from change orders in the shortest practicable time.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_43_304__d2597e39"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Agencies shall, in accordance with agency procedures, record and maintain data regarding the time required to definitize equitable adjustments associated with change orders for construction.
