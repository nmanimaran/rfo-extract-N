Prices will be adjusted only for increased labor costs (including subcontractor labor costs) as a result of the annual E.O. minimum wage, and for associated labor costs (including those for subcontractors). Associated labor costs must include increases or decreases that result from changes in social security and unemployment taxes and workers' compensation insurance, but will not otherwise include any amount for general and administrative costs, overhead, or profit.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The wage rate price adjustment under this clause is the lowest amount calculated by subtracting from the new E.O. wage rate the following: The current E.O. minimum wage rate; the current service or construction wage determination rate under the contract (if the wage rate is applicable to that worker); or the actual wage currently paid the worker. If the amount is zero or below, there will be no increase paid for this worker.</p><div class="agov-table-wrapper"><table aria-label="Presentation Table" class="table" role="presentation"><tbody class="tbody"><tr><td class="entry" colspan="2">(i) Example 1—New E.O. wage rate is $16.10.</td></tr><tr><td class="entry"><p class="p">Previous E.O. wage rate is $15.70.</p><p class="p">The current service or construction wage determination rate applicable to this worker under the contract is $15.75.</p></td><td class="entry">Analysis: The calculation is $16.10−$15.80 = $.30.
