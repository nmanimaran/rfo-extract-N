<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The contracting officer must obtain wage determinations for each new solicitation and contract in excess of $2,500.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Wage determinations based on prevailing rates.</em> Contractors performing on contracts to which no predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement applies must pay their employees at least the wages and fringe benefits found by the Department of Labor to prevail in the locality or, in the absence of a wage determination, the minimum wage set forth in the Fair Labor Standards Act. If the Wage Determinations at the SAM.gov database do not contain the applicable prevailing wage determination for a contract action, the contracting officer must use the e98 process to request a wage determination from the Department of Labor.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If the place of performance is unknown, the contracting officer must obtain a wage determination for each locality where services may be performed.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> If the contracting officer believes that there may be offerors interested in performing in unidentified places or areas, the contracting officer may use the following procedures:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Complete the fill-in of the clause at 52.222-49, Service Contract Labor Standards-Place of Performance Unknown (see 22.1002-2(f)).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The procedures in 14.304 must apply to late receipt of offerors' requests for wage determinations for additional places of performance. However, late receipt of an offeror's request for a wage determination for additional places of performance does not preclude the offeror's competing for the proposed acquisition.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> If the contracting officer receives any timely requests for wage determinations for additional places of performance the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Obtain wage determinations for the additional places of performance; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Amend the solicitation to include all wage determinations and, if necessary, extend the time for submission of final offers.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> If the successful offeror did not make a timely request for a wage determination and will perform in a place of performance for which the contracting officer therefore did not request a wage determination, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Award the contract;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Obtain a wage determination; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Incorporate the wage determination in the contract, retroactive to the date of contract award and with no adjustment in contract price, pursuant to the clause at 52.222-49, Service Contract Labor Standards-Place of Performance Unknown.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If the contracting officer subsequently learns of any potential offerors in previously unidentified places before the closing date for submission of offers, the contracting officer must obtain wage determinations for the additional places of performance and amend the solicitation to include all wage determinations. If necessary, the contracting officer must extend the time for submission of final offers.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Wage determinations based on collective bargaining agreements</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Early in the acquisition cycle, the contracting officer must determine whether 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) affects the new acquisition. The contracting officer must determine whether there is a predecessor contract covered by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute and, if so, whether the incumbent prime contractor or its subcontractors and any of their employees have a collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) provides that a successor contractor must pay wages and fringe benefits (including accrued wages and benefits and prospective increases) to service employees at least equal to those agreed upon by a predecessor contractor under the following conditions-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The services to be furnished under the proposed contract will be substantially the same as services being furnished by an incumbent contractor whose contract the proposed contract will succeed;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The services will be performed in the same locality; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The incumbent prime contractor or subcontractor is furnishing such services through the use of service employees whose wages and fringe benefits are the subject of one or more collective bargaining agreements.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The application of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) is subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) will not apply if the incumbent contractor enters into a collective bargaining agreement for the first time and the agreement does not become effective until after the expiration of the incumbent's contract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If the incumbent contractor enters into a new or revised collective bargaining agreement during the period of the incumbent's performance on the current contract, the terms of the new or revised agreement must not be effective for the purposes of 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) under the following conditions:</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span></p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(</span><em class="ph i"><span class="ph autonumber">1</span></em><span class="ph autonumber">)</span> In sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement less than 10 days before bid opening and finds that there is not reasonable time still available to notify bidders (see 22.1003(b)(1)); or</p><p class="ListL5"><span class="ph autonumber">(</span><em class="ph i"><span class="ph autonumber">2</span></em><span class="ph autonumber">)</span> For contractual actions other than sealed bidding, the contracting agency receives notice of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement after award, provided that the start of performance is within 30 days of award (see 22.1003(b)(2)); and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The contracting officer has given both the incumbent contractor and its employees' collective bargaining agent timely written notification of the applicable acquisition dates (see 22.1004-6).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> If 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) applies, the contracting officer must obtain a copy of any collective bargaining agreement between an incumbent contractor or subcontractor and its employees. Obtaining a copy of an incumbent contractor's collective bargaining agreement may involve coordination with the administrative contracting officer responsible for administering the predecessor contract. (Paragraph (m) of the clause at 52.222-41, Service Contract Labor Standards, requires the incumbent prime contractor to furnish the contracting officer a copy of each collective bargaining agreement.)</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> 41 U.S.C. 6707(c) will not apply if the Secretary of Labor determines—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> After a hearing, that the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a similar character in the locality; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> That the wages and fringe benefits in the predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement are not the result of arm's length negotiations. The Department of Labor (DOL) has concluded that contingent collective bargaining agreement provisions that attempt to limit a contractor's obligations by means such as requiring issuance of a wage determination by the DOL, requiring inclusion of the wage determination in the contract, or requiring the Government to adequately reimburse the contractor, generally reflect a lack of arm's length negotiations.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> If the contracting officer's review of the incumbent’s collective bargaining agreement indicates that its monetary provisions may be substantially at variance or may not have been reached as a result of arm's length bargaining, the contracting officer must immediately contact the agency labor advisor to consider if further action is warranted.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> If the services are being furnished at more than one location and the collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits are different at different locations or do not apply to one or more locations, the contracting officer must identify the locations to which the agreements apply.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> If the collective bargaining agreement does not apply to all service employees under the contract, the contracting officer must access Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> to obtain the prevailing wage determination for those service employee classifications that are not covered by the collective bargaining agreement. The contracting officer must separately list in the solicitation and contract the service employee classifications—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Subject to the collective bargaining agreement, and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Not subject to any collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(9)</span> If the contracting officer has submitted an e98 to Department of Labor requesting a wage determination based on a collective bargaining agreement and the Department of Labor is unable to provide the wage determination by the latest date needed to maintain the acquisition schedule, the contracting officer must incorporate the collective bargaining agreement itself in a solicitation and include a wage determination referencing that collective bargaining agreement created by use of the Wage Determinations at <em class="ph i">SAM.gov</em> website.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Requests for hearing</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A contracting agency or other interested party may request a hearing on an issue presented in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this subsection. To obtain a hearing for the contracting agency, the contracting officer must submit a written request through appropriate channels (ordinarily the agency labor advisor) to: Administrator, Wage and Hour Division, U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A request for a substantial variance hearing must include sufficient data to show that the rates at issue vary substantially from those prevailing for similar services in the locality. The request must also include—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The number of the wage determinations at issue;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The name of the contracting agency whose contract is involved;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> A brief description of the services to be performed under the contract;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The status of the procurement and any estimated procurement dates, such as bid opening, contract award, and commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option period;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> A statement of the applicant's case, setting forth in detail the reasons why the applicant believes that a substantial variance exists with respect to some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vii)</span> Any other data required by the Administrator.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> A request for an arm's length hearing must include—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> A statement of the applicant's case setting forth in detail the reasons why the applicant believes that the wages and fringe benefits contained in the collective bargaining agreement were not reached as a result of arm's length negotiations;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A statement regarding the status of the procurement and any estimated procurement dates, such as bid opening, contract award, and commencement date of the contract or its follow-up option period; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Names and addresses (to the extent known) of interested parties.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Unless the Administrator determines that extraordinary circumstances exist, the Administrator will not consider requests for a hearing unless received as follows:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For sealed bid contracts, more than 10 days before the award of the contract; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For negotiated contracts and for contracts with provisions exceeding the initial term by option, before the commencement date of the contract or the follow-up option period.</p></div>
