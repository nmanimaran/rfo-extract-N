          <p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_248_1__d3748e18"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. The Contractor is encouraged to develop, prepare, and submit value engineering change proposals (VECP’s) voluntarily. The Contractor shall share in any net acquisition savings realized from accepted VECP’s, in accordance with the incentive sharing rates in paragraph (f) of this clause.</p>

Acquisition savings include-
            <p class="ListL2" id="FAR_52_248_1__d3748e37"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Instant contract savings, which are the net cost reductions on this, the instant contract, and which are equal to the instant unit cost reduction multiplied by the number of instant contract units affected by the VECP, less the Contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs;</p>

On an instant contract, future contract savings include savings on increases in quantities after VECP acceptance that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, additional orders, and funding of subsequent year requirements on a multiyear contract.</p>

            <p class="ListL2" id="FAR_52_248_1__d3748e69"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Throughout the sharing period, unless the Contracting Officer decides that recalculation is necessary because conditions are significantly different from those previously anticipated; or</p>

It does not include increases in quantities after acceptance of the VECP that are due to contract modifications, exercise of options, or additional orders. If this is a multiyear contract, the term does not include quantities funded after VECP acceptance. If this contract is a fixed-price contract with prospective price redetermination, the term refers to the period for which firm prices have been established.</p>

As a minimum, the Contractor shall include in each VECP the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (7) of this clause.

If additional time is required, the Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within the 45-day period and provide the reason for the delay and the expected date of the decision. The Government will process VECP’s expeditiously; however, it will not be liable for any delay in acting upon a VECP.</p>

The Contracting Officer may accept the VECP, even though an agreement on price reduction has not been reached, by issuing the Contractor a notice to proceed with the change. Until a notice to proceed is issued or a contract modification applies a VECP to this contract, the Contractor shall perform in accordance with the existing contract. The decision to accept or reject all or part of any VECP is a unilateral decision made solely at the discretion of the Contracting Officer.</p>

If a VECP is accepted, the Contracting Officer will increase the instant contract amount by 20 percent of any projected collateral savings determined to be realized in a typical year of use after subtracting any Government costs not previously offset. However, the Contractor’s share of collateral savings will not exceed the contract’s firm-fixed-price or estimated cost, at the time the VECP is accepted, or $100,000, whichever is greater. The Contracting Officer is the sole determiner of the amount of collateral savings.</p>

The Contractor shall include an appropriate value engineering clause in any subcontract of $75,000 or more and may include one in subcontracts of lesser value. In computing any adjustment in this contract’s price under paragraph (f) of this clause, the Contractor’s allowable development and implementation costs shall include any subcontractor’s allowable development and implementation costs clearly resulting from a VECP accepted by the Government under this contract, but shall exclude any value engineering incentive payments to a subcontractor.
