            <p class="p List2">(2) Performed by the subcontractors; or</p>
            <p class="p List2">(3) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control.</p>
            <p class="p List1"><em class="ph i">Materials</em> means—</p>
            <p class="p List2">(1) Direct materials, including supplies transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control;</p>
            <p class="p List2">(2) Subcontracts for supplies and incidental services for which there is not a labor category specified in the contract;</p>

            <p class="p List1">(b)<em class="ph i">Inspection/Acceptance</em>. </p>
            <p class="p List2">(1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract at all places and times before acceptance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.</p>

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit.

            <p class="p List4">(B) Terminate this contract for cause.</p>
            <p class="p List3">(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract.</p>

            <p class="p List3">(i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor’s managerial personnel; or</p>
            <p class="p List3">(ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor’s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor’s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.</p>

            <p class="p List4">(B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract. Labor hours incurred to perform tasks for which labor qualifications were specified in the contract will not be paid to the extent the work is performed by individuals that do not meet the qualifications specified in the contract, unless specifically authorized by the Contracting Officer.</p>

            <p class="p List5">(<em class="ph i">1</em>) <em class="ph i">Other direct costs</em>. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: <em class="ph i">[Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert “None” if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided.

If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.</p>

            <p class="p List3">(iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(9) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.</p>
            <p class="p List2">(8)<em class="ph i">Prompt payment</em>. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
            <p class="p List1">(l)<em class="ph i">Termination for the Government’s convenience</em>. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work under this contract and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.</p>
            <p class="p List1">(m)<em class="ph i">Termination for cause</em>. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. The Government will send a cure notice to the Contractor, unless the reason for the termination is late delivery. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i), Payments, of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, the portion of the “hourly rate” attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>
