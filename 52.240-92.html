<p class="p">As prescribed in 40.302-3, insert the following clause:</p>
<p class="p Ctr_SmCaps">Security Requirements (Date) </p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> This clause applies to the extent that this contract involves access to information classified Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The Contractor shall comply with—</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The Security Agreement (DD Form 441), including the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (32 CFR part 117); and</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any revisions to that manual, notice of which has been furnished to the Contractor.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> If, after the date of this contract, the security classification or security requirements under this contract are changed by the Government and if the changes cause an increase or decrease in security costs or otherwise affect any other term or condition of this contract, the contract must be subject to an equitable adjustment as if the changes were directed under the Changes clause of this contract</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d) but excluding any reference to the Changes clause of this contract, in all subcontracts under this contract that involve access to classified information.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>A subcontractor requiring access to classified information under a contract shall be identified with a CAGE code on the DD Form 254. The Contractor shall require a subcontractor requiring access to classified information to provide its CAGE code with its name and location address or otherwise include it prominently in the proposal. Each location of subcontractor performance listed on the DD Form 254 is required to reflect a corresponding unique CAGE code for each listed location unless the work is being performed at a Government facility, in which case the agency location code shall be used. The CAGE code must be for that name and location address. Insert the word “CAGE” before the number. The CAGE code is required prior to award. The contractor shall ensure that subcontractors maintain their CAGE code(s) throughout the life of the contract.</p>

<span class="ph SmCaps">(DATE)</span>. If a cost contract for research and development with an educational institution is contemplated, add the following paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) to the basic clause:</p>
<p class="p List1">(f)(1) If a change in security requirements, as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c), results in a change in the security classification of this contract or any of its elements from an unclassified status or a lower classification to a higher classification, or in more restrictive area controls than previously required, then the Contractor must exert every reasonable effort compatible with the Contractor’s established policies to continue performing the work under the contract to comply with the change in security classification or requirements.</p>
<p class="p List2">(2) If, despite reasonable efforts, the Contractor determines that continuing work under this contract is not practical because of the change in security classification or requirements, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing. Until the Contracting Officer resolves this problem, the Contractor shall continue safeguarding all classified material as required by this contract.</p>
<p class="p List1">(g) After receiving the written notification, the Contracting Officer shall explore the circumstances surrounding the proposed change in security classification or requirements and must try to work out a mutually satisfactory method so the Contractor can continue doing the work under this contract.</p>
<p class="p List1">(h) If, 15 days after receipt by the Contracting Officer of the notification of the Contractor’s stated inability to proceed, the application to this contract of the change in security classification or requirements has not been withdrawn or a mutually satisfactory method for continuing performance of work under this contract has not been agreed upon, the Contractor may request the Contracting Officer to terminate the contract in whole or in part. The Contracting Officer shall terminate the contract in whole or in part, as may be appropriate, and the termination must be deemed a termination under the terms of the Termination for the Convenience of the Government clause.</p>

All prescribed identification shall immediately be delivered to the Contracting Officer, for cancellation upon the release of any employee. When required by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall obtain and submit fingerprints of all persons employed or to be employed on the project.</p>
