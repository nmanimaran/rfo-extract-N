<p class="ListL5" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e95">
<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>
<em class="ph i">The tax liability is finally determined</em>. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p class="ListL5" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e115">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>
<em class="ph i"></em>
<em class="ph i">The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment</em>. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p class="ListL3">
<span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span>The Offeror has <cite class="cite 52.209-5_d11e149VFI Checkbox">□</cite> has not <cite class="cite 52.209-5_d11e152VFI Checkbox">□</cite>, within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>"Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e168">
<span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e173">
<span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the Government will consider the certification in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e178">
<span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> This provision does not require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a). The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e183">
<span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If the Government later determines that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. </p>
