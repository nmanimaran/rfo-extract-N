    <h1>PGI 207.104-70 General procedures</h1>
    <pre>(b)  For acquisitions covered by DFARS 207.103- 70(a) (1) and (2) , correlate the plan to 
the DoD Future Years Defense Program, applicable budget submissions, and the decision coordinating paper/program memorandum, as appropriate.  It is incumbent upon the program manager  to coordinate the plan with all those who have a responsibility for the 
development, management, or administration of the acquisition.  The acquisition plan should be provided to the contract administration organization to facilitate resource allocation and planning for the evaluation, identification, and management of contractor performance risk.  
  (1 )  Acquisition background and objectives . 
   (i )  Statement of need .  Include— 
    (A)  Applicability of an acquisition decision document, a milestone decision 
review, or a service review, as appropriate.  
    (B)  The date approval for operational use has been or will be obtained.  If 
waivers are requested, describe the need for the waivers.  
    (C)  A milestone chart depicting the acquisition objectives.  
    (D)  Milestones for updating the acquisition plan.  Indicate when the plan will be 
updated.  Program managers should schedule recurring reviews and updates to coincide with DAB reviews and the transition from one phase to another (e.g., system development and demonstration to production and deployment).  
    (E)  Supplies and services.   To determine if acquisitions for supplies or services 
are covered by DFARS 208.2, acquisition officials must use the AbilityOne Program

and guidebooks at https://aaf.dau.edu/guidebooks/ . 
  (2 )  Plan of action. 
   (i )  Competition.   For information on various approaches that may be used to 
competitively fulfill DoD requirements, see the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics Actions to Improve Competition
. 
   ( ii)  Acquisition considerations .  When supplies or services will be acquired by 
placing an order under a non -DoD contract (e.g., a Federal Supply Schedule contract), 
regardless of whether the order is placed by DoD or by another agency on behalf of DoD, address the method of ensuring that the order will be consistent with DoD statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the acquisition and the requirements for use of DoD appropriated funds.  
   ( iii)  Budgeting and funding.  Include specific references to budget line items and 
program elements, where applicable, estimated production unit cost, and the total cost for remaining production.  
   ( iv)  Product or service descriptions .  For development acquisitions, describe the 
market research undertaken to identify commercial products or commercial services , 
commercial products or commercial services  with modifications, or nondevelopmental items 
other than commercial products (see FAR p art 10) that could satisfy the acquisition 
objectives.  
   (v )  Logistics considerations . 
    (A )  Describe the extent of integrated logistics support planning, including total 
life cycle system management and performance- based logistics.  Reference approved 
plans.   See PGI 245.103- 73
 for information on reporting requirements for Government 
inventory held by contractors under sustainment contracts in accordance with DoD Manual 4140.01, Volume 6, DoD Supply Chain Materiel Management Procedures: Materiel Returns, Retention, and Disposition. 
    (B)( 1)  Discuss the mission profile, reliability, and maintainability (R&amp;M) program 
plan, R&amp;M predictions, redundancy, qualified parts lists, parts and material qualification, R&amp;M requirements imposed on vendors, failure analysis, corrective action and feedback,  
and R&amp;M design reviews and trade- off studies.  Also discuss corrosion prevention and 
mitigation plans.  
     ( 2)  See the Under Secretary of Defense Acquisition and Sustainment 
Policy Memo, dated January 31, 2019, entitled “
Implementation of 10 U.S.C. 2443—
Sustainment Factors in Weapon System Design” and DoD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of 
the Adaptive Acquisition Framework , policies and procedures . 
    (C )  For all acquisitions, see part 227
 regarding technical data and associated 
license rights, and computer software and associated license rights.  For acquisitions involving major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems, see the additional requirements at DFARS 207.106- 70. 
 2026- O0020  
   (D)  See DoD 4120.24- M, Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Policies and 
Procedures.  
    (E)  Describe the extent of Computer -Aided Acquisition and Logistics Support 
(CALS) implementation (see MIL -STD- 1840C, Automated Interchange of Technical 
Information ). 
   (vi)  Environmental and energy conservation objectives . 
    (A)  Discuss actions taken to ensure either elimination of or authorization to use 
class I ozone -depleting chemicals and substances (see DFARS part 223).  
    (B)  Ensure compliance with DoDI 4715. 23, Integrated Recycling and Solid 
Waste Management . 
   (vii)  Other considerations . 
    (A)  National Technology and Industrial Base.  For major defense acquisition 
programs, address the following ( 10 U.S.C. 4811(c) )— 
     (1)  An analysis of the capabilities of the national technology and industrial 
base to develop, produce, maintain, and support such program, including consideration of the following factors related to foreign dependency ( 10 U.S.C. 4816) — 
      (i)  The availability of essential raw materials, special alloys, composite 
materials, components, tooling, and production test equipment for the sustained production of systems fully capable of meeting the performance objectives established for those systems; the uninterrupted maintenance and repair of such systems; and the sustained operation of such systems.  
      (ii)  The identification of items specified in paragraph (b)(19)(A) (1)(i) of 
this section that are available only from sources outside the national technology and industrial base.  
      (iii)  The availability of alternatives for obtaining such items from within 
the national technology and industrial base if such items become unavailable from sources outside the national technology and industrial base; and an analysis of any military vulnerabi lity that could result from the lack of reasonable alternatives.  
      (iv)  The effects on the national technology and industrial base that 
result from foreign acquisition of firms in the United States.  
     (2)  Consideration of requirements for efficient manufacture during the 
design and production of the systems to be procured under the program.  
     (3)  The use of advanced manufacturing technology, processes, and 
systems during the research and development phase and the production phase of the program.  
 2026- O0020  
     (4)  To the maximum extent practicable, the use of contract solicitations that 
encourage competing offerors to acquire, for use in the performance of the contract, modern 
technology, production equipment, and production systems (including hardware and software) that increase the productivity of the offerors and reduce the life- cycle costs.  
     (5)  Methods to encourage investment by U.S. domestic sources in 
advanced manufacturing technology production equipment and processes through—  
      (i)  Recognition of the contractor’s investment in advanced 
manufacturing technology production equipment, processes, and organization of work systems that build on workers’ skill and experience, and work force skill development in the development of the cont ract objective; and 
      (ii)  Increased emphasis in source selection on the efficiency of 
production.  
     (6)  Expanded use of commercial manufacturing processes rather than 
processes specified by DoD.  
     (7)  Elimination of barriers to, and facilitation of, the integrated manufacture 
of commercial products or commercial services and items being produced under DoD 
contracts.  
     (8)  Expanded use of commercial products or commercial services , 
commercial products or commercial services  with modifications, or to the extent commercial 
products or commercial services that meet the agency’s needs  are not available, 
nondevelopmental items other than commercial products (see FAR p art 10). 
     (9)  Acquisition of major weapon systems as commercial products  (see 
DFARS part 234 ). 
    (B)  Industrial capability (IC) . 
     (1)  Provide the program’s IC strategy that assesses the capability of the 
U.S. industrial base to achieve identified surge and mobilization goals.  If no IC strategy has been developed, provide supporting rationale for this position.  
     (2)  If, in the IC strategy, the development of a detailed IC plan was 
determined to be applicable, include the plan by text or by reference.  If the development of the IC plan was determined not to be applicable, summarize the details of the analysis forming the basis of this decision.  
     (3)  If the program involves peacetime and wartime hardware configurations 
that are supported by logistics support plans, identify their impact on the IC plan.  
    (C)  Special considerations for acquisition planning for crisis situations .  Ensure 
that the requirements of DoD Instruction 1100.22, Policy and Procedures for Determining 
Workforce Mix , are addressed.  Also—  
     (1)  Acquisition planning must consider whether a contract is likely to be 
performed in crisis situations outside the United States and must develop appropriately 
 2026- O0020  
 detailed measures for inclusion in the contract.  Combatant commanders establish 
operational plans identifying essential services that must continue during crisis.  DoDI 1100.22 requires Combatant Commanders to develop contingency plans if they have a reasonable doubt that a contractor will continue to provide essential services during a 
mobilization or crisis.  When planning the acquisition, consider these operational plans and the resources available to carry out these plans.  
     (2)  During acquisition planning, identify which services have been declared 
so essential that they must continue during a crisis situation.  A best practice is to create a separate section, paragraph, line, or other designation in the contract for these ess ential 
services so they can be tracked to an option or separate contract line item.  
     (3)  The requirements for the contractor written plan for continuity of 
essential services and the criteria for assessing the sufficiency of the plan will be 
determined/tailored for each acquisition of essential services by the contracting officer in 
coordination with the functional manager.  The contractor&#x27;s written plan, including prices/cost, shall be considered and evaluated in conjunction with the technical evaluation of offers.  
     (4)  Operational -specific contractor policies and requirements resulting from 
combatant commander “integrated planning” will be described in operation plans (OPLAN), operation orders (OPORD) or separate annexes, and must be incorporated into applicable contr acts.  The plans may include rules for theater entry, country clearance, use of weapons, 
living on -base, etc.  Therefore, the requiring activity is responsible for obtaining pertinent 
OPLANs, OPORDs, and annexes (or unclassified extracts) from the af fected combatant 
command or military service element or component and for ensuring that the contract is consistent with the theater OPLAN and OPORD.  
     (5)  Ask the requiring activity to confirm that the appropriate personnel 
department has determined that inherently Governmental functions are not included in the 
contract requirements.  If contract services will become inherently Governmental during a time of crisis, ensure that the contract states that work will be removed from the contract 
(temporarily or permanently) upon the occurrence of a triggering event (specified in the contract) or upon notice from the contracting officer that informs the contractor when its responsibility to perform affected duties will stop or restart.  The contract should require the contractor to have a plan for restarting performance after the crisis ends.  
     (6)  If the combatant commander’s contingency plan requires military 
members to replace contractor employees during a crisis or contingency, acquisition 
planning must consider whether the contract should require the contractor to train military members to do that.  
     (7)  For acquisitions that have or may have some portion of delivery of items 
or performance in a foreign country, address considerations and requirements set forth in DFARS 225.770, Contracts requiring performance or delivery in a foreign country; 225. 771, 
Contractor personnel supporting U.S. Armed Forces deployed outside the United States;  
225.772, Antiterrorism/force protection, and 225.773, Contract administration in support of 
contingency operations.  
     (8)  Contract administration planning considerations for contracts in support 
of contingency operations.  
     ( i)  When delegation of contract administration services to a contracting 
officer located in a different geographic area to support a contract for the delivery of items or performance in a joint operations area will or may occur, address the resourcing of contract administration and oversight personnel, including administrative contracting officers, quality assurance specialists, contract administrators, property administrators, and contrac ting 
officers’ representatives.  
      ( ii)  If contract delivery of items or performance in support of 
contingency operations will or may occur in an austere, uncertain, or hostile environment, address the need for logistics support of contract administration and oversight personnel.  
      ( iii)  When some portion of contract delivery of items or performance 
may take place in a contingency area, address pertinent combatant commander or joint force commander requirements and considerations for contract administration.  Such requirements will be maintained on the particular combatant commander operational contract support website, https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cc/aor.html . 
      ( iv)  When contracts are awarded for performance in a contingency 
area, the head of the contracting activity is responsible for planning to ensure that contingency contracts will be closed in a timely manner considering personnel turnover and preaward, contract administration, and other contracting workload.  A plan for reachback support of contract closeouts should be included, if required.  
     ( 9)  For contracts that will incorporate the clause at DFARS 252.225- 7040, 
Contractor Personnel Supporting U.S. Armed Forces Deployed Outside the United States,  in 
accordance with DFARS 225.771-5(a ), or otherwise require accountability for contractor  
personnel, consider the requirements and resources necessary for both the Government  
and contractor to keep the Synchronized Predeployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) current in accordance with the SPOT business rules available at the website provided at  
https://www.acq.osd.mil/asds/log/cso/ocs/spot.html
 . 
     ( 10)  For contracts that will incorporate the clause at FAR 52.222- 50, 
Combating Trafficking in Persons, consider the requirements and resources necessary for both the Government and contractor to implement and maintain compliance with Federal and DoD t rafficking in persons requirements, including PGI 222.1703. 
    (D )  Software and software maintenance.  When acquiring software or software 
maintenance, see DFARS 212.     (E )  Procurement Support for T heater Security Cooperation Efforts .  When 
planning procurement support for theater security cooperation efforts (e.g., military exercises/training, base operations, weapons procurement, aviation fuels, construction, or the President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief projects), planners should be aware that Department of State (DoS) missions (embassies and consulates) do not provide such contracting support; however, these missions can provide support for routine, non -complex 
services and supplies used by U.S. Government personnel, even if funded with foreign-military -sales case money (see DFARS PGI 225.78).  Planners s hall take the following 
steps:  
     ( 1)  Become familiar with DoS Cable 11 STATE 030953, “Procurement 
Roles and Responsibilities – General Services Officer and DoD Personnel” (see also 
DFARS PGI 225.78). 
 
    ( 2)  Request general guidance from the combatant -command coordinator 
on past practices in the particular location for which procurement support is to be requested;  
     ( 3)  Contact the Defense Attaché Office and/or General Services Officer 
(normally the embassy/consulate contracting officer) at the DoS mission at least 60 days prior to the requirement, or as soon as practicable, to obtain information on–       ( i)  Availability of, and procedures associated with, requesting DoS 
mission procurement support;  
      ( ii)  Local sources of supplies and services; and 
      ( iii)  Business payment practices to support DoD procurement of 
specific theater security cooperation procurement requirements.  
     ( 4)  Ascertain whether payment support is available from the DoS mission.  
     ( 5)  When DoS contracting support is determined to be unavailable or not 
allowed, ensure the party of DoD military and/or civilians deploying to support the particular Theater Security Cooperation effort either pre -arranges DoD contracting support through 
reach-back, if possible, or if necessary, includes a warranted contracting officer, field-
ordering officer, or credit -card holder, and, if necessary, a paying agent.</pre>
