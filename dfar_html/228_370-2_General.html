    <h1>228.370-2 General</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Assignment of a Government flight representative.   See PGI 228.370-2 (a) for 
procedures on assigning a Government flight representative (GFR) when using the clauses at 252.228- 70
01 and 252.228- 7007. 
  (b)  Preaward survey .  Before awarding any contract that includes the clause at 
252.228- 7001, Ground and Flight Risk, the contracting officer should obtain a preaward 
survey of the offeror’s proposed aircraft flight and ground operations facility.  If the offeror proposed subcontracting any aircraft work, the preaward survey should include a revi ew of the subcontractor’s facility.  For acquisitions falling under the exceptions at 
228.371(b)(1)(iii), (iv), and (vi), the contracting officer m
 ust review the documentation 
the offeror submitted with the proposal in response to the DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, to ensure the offeror’s commercial insurance provides the appropriate coverage required by the clause at 252.228 -7001. 
  (c)  Foreign military sales.  The exception for foreign military sales (FMS) contracts 
at 228.371 (b)(1)(iii) only applies to FMS cases where the FMS customer has explicitly 
refused assumption of risk of loss.  If the FMS customer has accepted the standard Letter of Offer and Acceptance Standard Terms and Conditions, as described in DoD 5105.38- M, Secu rity Assistance Management Manual, they have assumed risk of loss.  
  (
d)  Commercial derivative aircraft .  The exception at 228.371(b)(1)(iv) for 
commercial derivative aircraft only applies if the contractor is a licensed and certified Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) repair station for the specific model of aircraft under contract, when work is being performed pursuant to the FA A license under 14 
CFR part 145.  The FAA’s repair station search tool is available at https://av -
info.faa.gov/repairstation.asp .  All aircraft flying public aircraft operations operate 
under airworthiness certificates maintained by the military services.  The FAA airworthiness certificate in the exception in this paragraph (d) underlies the military service certificate.  
  (
e)  Insurance .  The clause at 252.228- 7001, Ground and Flight Risk, is intended to 
reduce acquisition costs by eliminating the costs of commercial insurance premiums.  This clause also is intended to encourage the contractor to perform safe and effective operations through inclusion of a contractor’s share of loss (i.e., a deductible).  Additionally, the clause requires compliance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations” (Air Force Instruction 10 -220, 
Army Regulation 95 -20, Naval Air Systems Comm and (NAVAIR) Instruction 3710.1 
(Series), Coast Guard Instruction M13020.3 (Series), and Defense Contract Management Agency Instruction 8210- 1 (Series)), which provides procedures to 
mitigate the risk of loss to the Government.  For this reason, paragraph (e)(4)(ii) of the 
clause at 252.228- 700
 1 s pecifies that insurance premium costs are unallowable.  In 
addition, paragraph (d)(4) of the clause provides that the Government’s assumption of risk does not apply where the loss or damage is covered by available insurance.  
 28 
  (f)  Damage to Government aircraft . 
 
  (1)  Whenever damage to Government aircraft is reported, each incident should 
be evaluated on its own merits.  When the cost of repair exceeds the contractor’s share of loss provisions, the contracting officer must  make a liability determination in 
accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.  
   (2)  Contracting officers should consult with the requiring activity and the 
assigned contract administration office on replacement, repair, or beyond economic repair decisions.  
   (3)  See PGI 228.370-2 (f) for an example of accident or mishap damage versus 
workmanship -error damage.  
  (g
)  Contracting officer determination of liability . 
   (1)  When making a liability determination, the contracting officer should seek 
input from the GFR and legal counsel, as needed.  
   (2)  The Government’s assumption of risk must not extend to damage, loss, or 
destruction of covered aircraft that — 
    (i)  Is the result of willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of the 
contractor’s managerial personnel, including the contractor’s oversight of subcontractors;  
    (ii)  Is sustained during flight if either the flight or the crewmembers have 
not been approved in advance and in writing by the GFR, who has been authorized in accordance with the combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground  Operations”;  
    (iii)  Occurs in the course of transportation by rail, or by conveyance on 
public streets, highways, or waterways, unless the transportation is limited to the vicinity of the contractor’s premises, and incidental to work performed under the contract as described in the Schedule;  
    (iv)  Is covered by insurance;  
    (v)  Occurs after the contracting officer has, in writing, revoked the 
Government’s assumption of risk; or  
    (vi)  Is sustained due to workmanship errors.  
  (h)  Notice of revocation of the Government’s assumption of risk .  The liability 
provisions of the clause at FAR 52.245- 1, Government Property, do not apply to the 
aircraft impacted by a notice of revocation.  
   (1)  Preliminary notice of revocation . 
    (i)  When finding that contractor managerial personnel have failed to comply 
with the combined regulation/instruction, as required by paragraph (b) of the clause at 252.228- 7001, including finding the covered aircraft are exposed to unreasonable 
conditions , the contracting officer must  issue a preliminary notice of revocation of the 
 28 
 Government’s assumption of risk to the contractor and must  require the contractor to 
comply with contract requirements.  Factors for the contracting officer to consider in 
determining exposure to unreasonable conditions include, but are not limited to, the following:  
     (A)  Lack of adequate hangar fire suppression or firefighting vehicles;  
     (B)  Failure to provide adequate procedures to the GFR; or  
     (C)  Systemic failure to comply with approved procedures.  
    (ii)  The preliminary notice of revocation will state the timeframe for the 
contractor to correct the noncompliance or conditions.  
   (2)  Notice of revocation .  If the contractor fails to correct the cited 
noncompliance or conditions within the specified timeframe, the contracting officer must  issue to the contractor a notice of revocation of the Government’s assumption of 
risk for any covered aircraft.  
    (i)  Thereafter the contractor assumes the entire risk for damage, loss, or 
destruction of the previously covered aircraft.  
    (ii)  Any costs incurred by the contractor, including the costs of the 
contractor’s self -insurance, insurance premiums paid to insure the contractor’s 
assumption of risk, deductibles associated with such purchased insurance, etc., to mitigate its risk a re unallowable costs.  
    (iii)  The notice of revocation does not relieve the contractor of its obligation 
to comply with all other provisions of the clause at 252.228- 7001, including the 
combined regulation/instruction entitled “Contractor’s Flight and Ground Operations ”. 
  
  (iv)  Within 3 days of receipt of the contractor’s notice of correction, the 
contracting officer must  notify the contractor whether the Government will resume risk 
of loss.  The contracting officer must  determine that the noncompliance or cited 
conditions have been corrected prior to resuming assumption of risk.  
    (v)  Any disputes regarding the contracting officer’s notice of revocation must  
be subject to FAR clause 52.233- 1, Disputes.  
  (i)  Procedures in the event of damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft . 
   (1)  In the event of damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft, except in 
cases covered by paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the contracting officer must  evaluate 
the contractor’s statement of — 
    (i)  The damaged, lost, or destroyed aircraft;  
    (ii)  The time and origin of the damage, loss, or destruction;  
    (iii)  All known interests in commingled property of which aircraft are a part; 
and 
    (iv)  The insurance, if any, covering the interest in commingled property.  
 28 
  (2)  If a new production aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed before it has 
become a covered aircraft, the Government bears no responsibility for risk of loss.  
   (3)  If a new production aircraft is damaged, lost, or destroyed after it has 
become a covered aircraft, the contracting officer must  provide written direction to the 
contractor to take action in accordance with the contracting officer’s written direction that the aircraft shall be — 
    (i)  Replaced;  
    (ii)  Repaired to the condition immediately prior to the damage; or 
    (iii)  Considered beyond economic repair.  The contracting officer must  
decide whether further actions are required under the contract.  
   (4)  If a covered aircraft that has been furnished by the Government to the 
contractor is damaged, lost, or destroyed while covered, the contracting officer must  
provide written direction to the contractor that the aircraft shall be — 
    (i)  Repaired; or  
    (ii)  Considered beyond economic repair.  The contracting officer must  decide 
further actions required under the contract.  
   (5)  The contracting officer must  make an equitable adjustment for expenditures 
made in performing the obligations under paragraph (h) of the clause at 252.228- 7001. 
  (j)  Contracting officer determination of the contractor’s share of loss. 
   (1)  The contractor’s share of loss or damage to covered aircraft, except for loss or 
damage caused by negligence of Government personnel, is the least of — 
    (i)  $200,000;  
    (ii)  20 percent of the price or estimated acquisition cost of affected aircraft; 
or 
    (iii)  20 percent of the price or estimated cost of the contract, task order, or 
delivery order.  
   (2)  If the Government requires covered aircraft to be replaced or repaired by the 
contractor, any resulting equitable adjustment must  not include reimbursement of the 
contractor’s share of loss.  
   (3)  In the event the Government does not decide to replace or repair the covered 
aircraft, the clause at 252.228- 7001 re
quires the contractor to credit the contract price 
or pay the Government, as directed by the contracting officer, the least of — 
  
  (i)  $200,000;  
    (ii)  20 percent of the price or estimated acquisition cost of affected aircraft; 
or 
 28 
   (iii)  20 percent of the price or estimated cost of the contract, task order, or 
delivery order.  
   (4)  The costs incurred by the contractor for its share of the loss and for insuring 
against that loss are unallowable costs, including but not limited to — 
    (i)  The contractor’s share of loss under the Government’s self -insurance;  
    (ii)  The costs of the contractor’s self -insurance;  
    (iii)  The deductible for any contractor -purchased insurance;  
    (iv)  Insurance premiums paid for contractor -purchased insurance; and  
    (v)  Costs associated with determining, litigating, and defending against the 
contractor’s liability.  
  (k)  Reimbursement from a third party .  If the contracting officer finds or has reason 
to believe that the contractor has been reimbursed or otherwise compensated by a third party for damage, loss, or destruction of covered aircraft and has also been compensated by the Government, then the co ntracting officer must  demand an equitable 
reimbursement.  If the contracting officer requests that the contractor provide reasonable assistance in obtaining recovery, such effort must  be an allowable expense of 
the co ntractor.</pre>
