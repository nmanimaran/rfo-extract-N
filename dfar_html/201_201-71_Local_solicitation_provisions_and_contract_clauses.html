    <h1>201.201-71 Local solicitation provisions and contract clauses</h1>
    <pre>2026 -O0002  
  (a)  Contract clauses and solicitation provisions developed by departments and agencies 
(i.e., local clauses) that constitute a significant revision must  be published for public 
comment in the Federal Register  in accordance with DFARS 201.101.  
 
  (1)  A local clause is considered a significant revision if the clause—  
    (i)  Contains a new certification requirement for contractors or offerors that is not 
imposed by statute (see FAR 1.10 6 and DFARS 201.106);  
    (ii)  Constitutes a deviation (as defined at FAR 1.3 ) from the parts and subparts 
identified at DFARS 201.302; or 
    (iii)  Will be used on a repetitive basis and—  
     (A)  Imposes a new requirement for the collection of information from 10 or 
more members of the public (see FAR 1.105 ); or 
     (B)  Has any cost or administrative impact on contractors or offerors beyond 
that contained in the FAR or DFARS.  
   (2)  A local clause is not considered a significant revision, if the clause — 
    (i)  Is for a one-time use intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition 
(e.g.,  a clause developed as a result of negotiations and documented in the business 
clearance or similar document), except for clauses that constitute a deviation (as defined at FAR 1. 301) from the parts and subparts identified at DFARS 201. 302; or 
    (ii)  May be used on a repetitive basis and has no new or additional cost or 
administrative impact on contractors or offerors beyond any cost or administrative impact 
contained in existing FAR or DFARS coverage.</pre>
