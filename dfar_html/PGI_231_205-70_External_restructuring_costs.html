    <pre>(d)  Procedures and ACO responsibilities.  The cognizant ACO will—  
   (i)  Promptly execute a novation agreement, if one is required, in accordance with 
FAR Subpart 42.12 and DFARS Subpart 242.12 and include the provision at DFARS 
242.1204( i). 
   (ii)  Direct the contractor to segregate restructuring costs and to suspend these 
amounts from any billings, final contract price settlements, and overhead settlements until the determination in DFARS 231.205- 70(c)(4 )(i) is obtained.  
   (iii)  Require the contractor to submit an overall plan of restructuring activities and an 
adequately supported proposal for planned restructuring projects.  The proposal must include a breakout by year by cost element, showing the present value of projected restructuring costs and projected restructuring savings.  
   (iv)  Notify major buying activities of contractor restructuring actions and inform them 
about any potential monetary impacts on major weapons programs, when known.  
   (v)  Upon receipt of the contractor’s proposal, as soon as practicable, adjust forward 
pricing rates to reflect the impact of projected restructuring savings.  If restructuring costs are included in forward pricing rates prior to execution of an advance agre ement in accordance 
with paragraph (d)( viii) of this subsection, the contracting officer shall include a repricing 
clause in each fixed -price action that is priced based on the rates.  The repricing clause

231.205- 70(c)(4)(i)(A); or       
    (B)  If the audited projected restructuring savings will exceed the restructuring 
costs allowed in a case where the business combination will result in the preservation of a

 critical capability that otherwise might be lost to DoD, as required by DFARS 231.205-
70(c)(4)(i)(B) . 
   (viii)  Negotiate an advance agreement with the contractor setting forth, at a 
minimum, a cumulative cost ceiling for restructuring projects and, when necessary, a cost amortization schedule.  The costs may not exceed the amount of projected restructuring savin gs on a present value basis.  The advance agreement shall not be executed until the 
determination required by DFARS 231.205- 70(c)(4)(i) is obtained.
