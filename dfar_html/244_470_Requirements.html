    <h1>244.470 Requirements</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Contractors are required to  determine if subcontract item s are commercial 
product s or commercial service s, using reasonable business judgement and following 
FAR part 10 market research guidance .  This requirement does not affect the 
contracting officer’s responsibilities or determinations made under FAR 15.403 -2(c)(3).   
  (b)  Items that are valued at less than $10,000 per item purchased for use in the 
performance of multiple DoD and non-DoD contracts and are not identifiable to any 
particular contract when purchased , shall be treated as commercial products, even 
though the items may not meet the definition of “commercial product” at FAR 2.101 and do not require a commercial product determination  (10 U.S.C. 3457(c)) .
