    <h1>232.072-3 Cash flow forecasts</h1>
    <pre>(a)  C ontractor s are required  to sustain a sufficient cash flow to perform the contract.  
If the contractor’s cashflow is questionable, t he contracting officer should require the 
contractor to submit a cash flow forecast covering the duration of the contract.  
  (b)  A contractor’s inability or refusal to prepare and provide cash flow forecasts or to 
reconcile actual cash flow with previous forecasts is a strong indicator of serious managerial deficiencies or potential contract cost or performance problems.  
  (c)  Single or one -time cash flow forecasts are of limited forecasting power  and should 
be limited to preaward survey situations.  Establish reliable cash flow forecasts by 
comparing a series of previous actual cash flows with the corresponding forecasts and examining the causes of any differences.  
  (d)   See PGI 232.072 -3(d) for cash flow forecast requirements  
  (e)  See PGI 232.072- 3(e) for guidance on cash flow forecast assumptions .  
  (f)  The contracting officer should review the assumptions underlying the cash flow 
forecasts.  In determining whether the assumptions are reasonable and realistic, the contracting officer should consult with  
   (1)  The contractor;  
   (2)  Government personnel in the areas of finance, engineering, production, cost, 
and price analysis; or  
   (3)  Prospective supply, subcontract, and loan or credit sources.</pre>
