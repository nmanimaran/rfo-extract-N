    <h1>219.302-2 Compliance with the plan</h1>
    <pre>(a) See PGI 219.302- 2 for guidance on reviewing subcontracting reports.  
   (1)(A) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3903, section 9077 of Pub. L. 102 -396, and 
subsequent Defense appropriations acts, subcontracts awarded to qualified nonprofit agencies (NPA) approved by the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely  Disabled (41 U.S.C. chapter 85) may be counted toward the prime contractor’s 
small business subcontracting goal.  
    (B) Unless the prime contractor has reason to question the representations, 
it may accept a subcontractor&#x27;s written representations of its status as a qualified NPA approved by the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled, o r a historically black college or university or minority institution.  
   (2) With respect to subcontracting plans approved under the Test Program for 
Negotiation of Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans (see 219.206 -70), 
the designated contracting officer will conduct a compliance review during the fiscal 
year aft er the close of the fiscal year for which the plan is applicable by comparing the 
approved percentage or dollar goals to the total, actual subcontracting dollars covered by the comprehensive subcontracting plan. The requirements at FAR 19.302 -2(b) and 
(c) apply to compliance assessments of comprehensive subcontracting plans.  
  (e)  If a prime contractor listed a small business subcontractor in its bid or proposal 
and replaces that small business with an other  than small business, it must notify the 
administrative contracting officer in writing within a reasonable amount of time after the subcontract is awarded.
