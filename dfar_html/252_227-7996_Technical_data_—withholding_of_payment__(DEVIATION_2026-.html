As prescribed at 227.7103- 6(g)(2) or 227.7104- 4(b)(5), use the following clause  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
TECHNICAL DATA— WITHHOLDING OF PAYMENT (DEVIATION 2026 -O0036)  
(FEB 2026)  
 
 (a)  If technical data  the Contractor must deliver  under this contract is not delivered 
within the time specified by this contract or is deficient upon delivery (including having 
restrictive markings not identified in the list described in the clause at 252.227 -
7989(f)(2) or 252.227 -7993(f)(2) of this contract), the Contracting Officer may until such 
data is accepted by the Government, withhold payment to the Contractor of ten percent (10%) of the total contract price or amount unless a lesser withholding  is specified in the 
contract.  Payments shall not be withheld  nor any other action taken pursuant to this 
paragraph when the Contractor’ s failure to make timely delivery or to deliver such data 
without deficiencies arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.  
  (b)  The withholding of any amount or subsequent payment to the Contractor shall 
not be construed as a waiver of any rights accruing to the Government under this contract.
