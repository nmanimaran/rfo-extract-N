 (d) Commerciality determination .  To the extent necessary to make a commercial 
product determination in accordance with part 212 that relies on paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) of the “commercial product” definition at FAR 2.101 for a subsystem, component, or spare part as described  in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the 
provision at 252.215 -7010, Requirements for Certified Cost or Pricing Data and Data 
Other Than Certified Cost or Pricing Data, requires the offeror to — 
   (1) Identify the comparable commercial product the offeror sells to the general 
public or nongovernmental entities for other than governmental purposes;  
   (2) Provide a comparison between the physical characteristics and functionality 
of the comparable commercial product and the subsystem, component, or spare part, including — 
    (i) For products under paragraph (3)(i) of the “commercial product” definition 
at FAR 2.101, a description of the modification and documentation to support that the modification is customarily available in the marketplace; or  
    (ii) For products under paragraph (3)(ii) of the “commercial product” 
definition at FAR 2.101, a detailed description of the modification and detailed technical data to demonstrate that the modification is minor (e.g., information on production processe s and material differences); and  
   (3) Provide the national stock number (NSN) for the comparable commercial 
product, if one is assigned, and the NSN for the subsystem, component, or spare part, if one is assigned; or  
   (4) If the offeror does not sell a comparable commercial product to the general 
public or nongovernmental entities for other than governmental purposes, then require the offeror to — 
    (i) Notify the contracting officer in writing that it does not sell such a 
comparable product; and     (ii) Provide the contracting officer a comparison between the physical 
characteristics and functionality of the most comparable commercial product in the commercial market and the subsystem, component, or spare part, if available.  
  
 (e) Relevant information to determine price reasonableness .  (1) Unless an exception 
at FAR part 15 applies — 
    (i) To the extent necessary to make a determination of price reasonableness, 
require the offeror to submit or provide access to a representative sample, as determined by the contracting officer, of prices paid for the same or similar commercial products un der comparable terms and conditions by both Government and commercial 
customers and the terms and conditions of such sales; or     (ii) If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide or

 representative sample, as determined by the contracting officer, of the prices paid for 
the same or similar commercial products sold under different terms and conditions and the terms and conditions of such sales.

    (iii) Commercial customer purchasing the product for a commercial, mixed, 
or unknown purpose.  
   (3) If the contracting officer determines that the information submitted 
pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price because the comparable commercial product provided by the offeror is not a va lid basis for price analysis or the proposed price is not reasonable after 
evaluating sales data, then obtain approval from an official one level above the contracting officer, without power of delegation, and require the offeror to submit other relevant information regarding the basis for price or cost, including information on labor costs, material costs, and overhead rates.  
   (4) Do not require an offeror to submit information described in paragraph (e)(1) 
of this section with regard to a commercially available off -the-shelf item. If necessary, 
require an offeror to submit such information with regard to any other item that w as 
developed exclusively at private expense only after the head of the contracting activity 
determines in writing that the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price.  
   (5) If an offeror submits information or analysis relating to the value of a 
commercial product to support the determination of price reasonableness for the commercial product, consider such information or analysis in addition to the information submitte d pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section. For additional
