    <h1>PGI 227.7104-2 Rights in SBIR or STTR data</h1>
    <pre>The clause under which the SBIR/STTR data were generated or developed will govern the Government’s license rights in such SBIR/STTR data.  The following examples illustrate the definition of the SBIR/STTR data protection period and the applicability of the  DFARS 
252.227- 7993  clause:  
  (1)  Redelivery of SBIR data.  
   (i)  SBIR data first generated under a prior SBIR clause and redelivered under the 
current SBIR clause .  In this example, a contractor generates and delivers SBIR data under 
a 2016 phase II SBIR contract that includes a prior version of the clause at DFARS 252.227-
7993.  The contractor delivers identical data in a contiguous series of follow -on contracts, 
including a later phase III contract that is an extension of the research effort in the 2016 contract.  That phase III contract includes the current version of the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7993 .  The contractor asserts SBIR data rights in these data.  The 2016 contract 
included the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7993, which defined the SBIR data protection period 
as the period commencing with contract award and ending upon the date 5 years after completion of the project from which such data were generated.  This previous definition of the SBIR data protection period applies to the redelivered SBIR data in the contiguous series of follow -on contracts, including the later phase III contract.  The SBIR data protection 
period is extended because the later contract derives from, extends, or completes an effort made under a prior SBIR contract that included the prior version of the clause at DFARS</pre>
