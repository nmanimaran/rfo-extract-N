hereby agrees to comply with that order and to perform work on such vessel within its capabilities.

   (2)  The Contractor shall, upon request, furnish the Contracting Officer with a 
breakdown of costs incurred by the Contractor and an estimate of costs expected to be incurred in the performance of the work.

   (3)  Failure of the parties to agree upon the price of the work shall constitute a 
dispute within the meaning of the Disputes clause of the Master Agreement.  In the

  (c)(1)  If the nature of any repairs is such that their extent and probable cost cannot 
be ascertained readily, the Contracting Officer may issue a job order (on a sealed bid or negotiated basis) to determine the nature and extent of required repairs.  
   (2)  Upon determination by the Contracting Officer of what work is necessary, 
the Contractor, if requested by the Contracting Officer, shall negotiate prices for performance of that work.  The prices agreed upon shall be set forth in a modification of the job order.
