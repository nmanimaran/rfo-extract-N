    <h1>203.903 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(1)  Prohibition .  10 U.S.C. 4701 prohibits contractors and subcontractors from 
discharging, demoting, or otherwise discriminating against an employee as a reprisal 
for disclosing, to any of the entities listed at paragraph (3) of this section, information 
that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a DoD 
contract, a gross waste of DoD funds, an abuse of authority relating to a DoD contract, a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a DoD contract (including the com petition 
for or negotiation of a contract), or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.  Such reprisal is prohibited even if undertaken at the request of an executive 
branch official, unless the request takes the form of a non- discretionary directive and is 
within the authority of the executive branch official making the request.  
  (2)  Classified information .  As provided in section 827(h) of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013, nothing in this subpart provides any rights to disclose classified information not otherwise provided by law.  
  (3)  Entities to whom disclosure may be made include : 
   (i)  A Member of Congress or a representative of a committee of Congress.  
   (ii)  An Inspector General that receives funding from or has oversight over 
contracts awarded for or on behalf of DoD.  
   (iii)  The Government Accountability Office.  
   (iv)  A DoD employee responsible for contract oversight or management.  
   (v)  An authorized official of the Department of Justice or other law enforcement 
agency.  
   (vi)  A court or grand jury.  
   (vii)  A management official or other employee of the contractor or subcontractor 
who has the responsibility to investigate, discover, or address misconduct.  
  (4)  Disclosure clarified .  An employee who initiates or provides evidence of 
contractor or subcontractor misconduct in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to waste, fraud, or abuse on a DoD contract will be deemed to have made a 
disclosure.
