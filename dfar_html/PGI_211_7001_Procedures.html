    <h1>PGI 211.7001 Procedures</h1>
    <pre>Requiring activities are responsible for developing and distributing purchase requests, 
except for the requirements for Military Interdepartmental Purchase Requests (MIPRs) 
(DD Form 448) addressed in 253.208-1  . 
(a) Agencies may use a combined numbering series for MIPRs and internal 
purchase requests, following the rules at  253.208-1  (c)(1) for both. If using a separate 
numbering sequence for internal purchase requests, agencies must  have procedures 
that ensure the same number cannot be assigned to both a MIPR and an internal 
purchase request. Use of a purely internal tracking number in addition to the purchase request number is authorized and supported by the data standards. Number the purchase request by using— 
 11 
P
age 2 of 3 (
1) The requiring activity’s Department of Defense Activity Address Code
(DODAAC), as described in DLM 4000.25 Volume 6, Chapter 2. DODAACs may be 
verified at https://home.daas.dla.mil/eDoDAAD/s_search/search_menu.asp. 
(2) A serial number of eight alphanumeric characters, excluding “I” and “O”; and
(3) A revision number, with the original request being assigned zero and
subsequent revisions or amendments being numbered consecutively.  
(b) Prior to taking action on a purchase request, contracting officers must  ensure
that the requiring activity has prepared the purchase requests in uniform contract format 
(see FAR 14.201- 1 and 15. 109), except for procurement of construction (see part 36), 
which should follow the current edition of the Construction Specifications Institute format. Purchase requests shall include all supporting documentation required by local contract procedures.  
(c) Prior to taking action on a purchase request, contracting officers must  ensure that
the purchase requests follow the line item rules and data requirements in DFARS 204.71 .
 Purchase requests for individual supplies (i.e., not bulk commodities 
such as oil) must  identify whether the item to be acquired is subject to the item unique 
identification requirements of DFARS  211.274-2 . 
(d)(1) Purchase requests may be unfunded for planning purposes, partially funded, 
or fully funded.  
(2) Funding data in purchase requests will, at a minimum, identify the following
el
ements of the funding source: Department Code (e.g. 21 Army), Main Account (e.g. 
1804, Operation and Maintenance, Navy), Subaccount (where applicable), and Fiscal Year. Lists of these codes are published in Supplement 1 to Volume I of the Treasury  
Financial  Manual,  Federal  Account  Symbols  and Titles , generally referred to as  The 
FAST  Book  at https://tfx.treasury.gov/reference- books/fast -book . 
(3) Agencies must  have sufficient procedures in place to enable traceability of
line items identified in the purchase request to those in the resulting contract. In developing such procedures, agencies must  ensure that provisions are made for 
circumstances in which the deliverables may be more completely defined during the process of soliciting offers and making an award.  
(e) Contracting officers must  not obligate funds that have not been certified as
currently available and suitable. R eview purchase requests to ensure they are certified 
after agreement on price and prior to award to ensure that the funds are— 
(1) Suitable and available for the purpose and amount of the contract; and
(2) Traceable from the purchase request to the resultant contract.
(f) Purchase requests transmitted between requiring systems and contract writing
systems must  be transmitted via the Global EXchange system (GEX) using the 
 11 
 Purchase Request Data Standard Extensible Markup Language (XML) format 
at https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/ds/procurement-data-standard.html . Copies 
must be sent via the GEX to the Electronic Data Access (EDA) system 
at http://eda.ogden.disa.mil . Requiring systems and contract writing systems may use a 
format that can be translated to or from the purchase request Data Standard (XML) 
format.</pre>
