    <pre>As used in this subpart — 
  “Contract action” means an action which results in a contract.  
   (1)  It includes contract modifications for additional supplies or services.  
   (2)  It includes task orders and delivery orders.  
   (3)  It does not include change orders, administrative changes, funding 
modifications, or any other contract modifications that are within the scope and under the terms of the contract, e.g., engineering change proposals, value engineering change proposa ls, and over and above work requests as described in subpart 217.77.   
 17 
  “Definitization” means the agreement on, or determination of, contract terms, 
specifications, and price, which converts the undefinitized contract action to a definitive 
contract.  
  “Qualifying proposal” means a proposal that contains sufficient information to 
enable DoD to conduct meaningful analyses and audits of the information contained in the proposal.  
  “Undefinitized contract action” means any contract action for which the contract 
terms, specifications, or price are not agreed upon before performance is begun under the action.  Examples are letter contracts, orders under basic ordering agreements, and provisioned item orders, for which the price has not been agreed upon before performance has begun.</pre>
