    <h1>PGI 249.109-7 Settlement by determination</h1>
    <pre>(1)  Use a Standard Form 30 (SF 30), Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of 
Contract, to settle a convenience termination by determination—    (i)  When the contractor has lost its right of appeal because it failed to submit a 
timely settlement proposal; and  
   (ii)  To confirm the determination when the contractor does not appeal the 
termination contracting officer&#x27;s decision.  
  (2)  The effective date of the SF 30 must  be the same as the date of the letter of 
determination.  Do not assign a supplementary procurement instrument identification number to the letter of determination.  Send a copy of the SF 30 to the contractor by certified mail return receipt requested.
