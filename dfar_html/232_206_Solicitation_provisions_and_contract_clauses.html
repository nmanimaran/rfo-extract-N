    <h1>232.206 Solicitation provisions and contract clauses</h1>
    <pre>(f)  Prompt payment for commercial purchase payments.   The contracting officer 
must  incorporate the following standard prompt payment terms for commercial product 
and commercial service contract financing:  
   (i)  Commercial advance payments:   The contractor entitlement date specified in 
the contract, or 30 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.  
   (ii)  Commercial interim payments:   The contractor entitlement date specified in 
the contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.  The prompt payment standards for commercial 
delivery payments must  be the same as specified in FAR Subpart 32.9 for invoice 
payments for the item delivered.  
  (g)  Installment payment financing for commercial products and commercial services.    
Installment payment financing is prohibited  unless market research has established 
that this form of contract financing is both appropriate and customary in the commercial marketplace.  When installment payment financing is used, the contracting officer must  use the ceiling percentage of contract price that is customary in the 
particular marketplace (not to exceed the maximum rate established in FAR 52.232 -30).</pre>
