    <pre>(a)  Requirement . 
   (i)  The threshold for DoD awards is $ 9 million.  Report all contractual actions,  
including modifications, that have a face value, excluding unexercised options, of more  
than $9 million.  
    (A)  For undefinitized contractual actions, report the not- to-exceed (NTE)  
amount.  Later, if the definitized amount exceeds the NTE amount by more than $9 million, report only the amount exceeding the NTE.  
    (B)  For indefinite delivery, time and material, labor hour, and similar  
contracts, report the initial award if the estimated face value, excluding unexercised  
options, is more than $ 9 million.  Do not report orders up to the estimated value, but  
after the estimated value is reached, report subsequent modifications and orders that  
have a face value of more than $9 million.  
    (C)  Do not report the same work twice.
