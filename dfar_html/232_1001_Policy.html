    <h1>232.1001 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(a)  As with all contract financing, the purpose of performance -based payments is to 
assist the contractor in the payment of costs incurred during the performance of the contract.  See PGI 232.1001(a) for additional information on use of performance -based 
payments.  However, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3802(a)(2), performance -based 
payments must  not be conditioned upon costs incurred in contract performance, but on 
the achievement of performance outcomes.  Subject to the criteria in 232.1003 -70, all 
companies, including nontraditional defense contractors, are eligible for performance -
based payments, consistent with best commercial practices.  
  (d)  The contracting officer must  use the following standard payment terms for 
performance -based payments:  The contractor entitlement date, if any, specified in the 
contract, or 14 days after receipt by the designated billing office of a proper request for payment, whichever is later.</pre>
