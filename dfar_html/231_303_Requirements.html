    <h1>231.303 Requirements</h1>
    <pre>(1)  Do not place limitations on the reimbursement of otherwise allowable indirect 
costs incurred on DoD contracts awarded to institutions of higher education on or after 
November 30, 1993, unless that same limitation is applied uniformly to all other 
organizations performing similar work under DoD contracts (section 841 of Pub. L. 103 -
160).  DoD contracts awarded on or after November 30, 1993, to institutions of higher 
education are exempt from the 26 percent indirect cost limitation imposed by OMB 
Circular No. A -21 because the same limitation is not uniformly applied to other 
organizations performing similar work.  
  (2)  The administrative contracting officer can waive the 231.303(1) prohibition if the 
governing body of the institution of higher education requests the waiver to simplify its 
overall management of DoD cost reimbursements under DoD contracts.  The 
administrative contracting officer can waive the 231.303(1) prohibition if the university requests it to simplify managing DoD cost reimbursements.  
  (3)  Under 10 U.S.C. 4652, the costs cited in 231.205- 22(a) are unallowable.</pre>
