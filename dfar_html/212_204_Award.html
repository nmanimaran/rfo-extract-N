    <pre>(a)  Price reasonableness.   
   (1) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3453(d), agencies must  conduct or obtain 
market research to support the determination of the reasonableness of price for commercial products and commercial services  contained in any bid or offer submitted in 
response to an agency solicitation.  To the extent necessary to support such market research, the contracting officer — 
    (i )  In the case of major weapon systems , for subsystems of major weapon 
systems and components and spare parts of major weapon systems and of subsystems of major weapon systems  acquired as commercial products  in accordance with subpart 
234.70, must  use information submitted under 234.7002
(e); and  
    ( ii)  In the case of other items, may require the offeror to submit other 
relevant information.  
 12 
  (2 )  If the contracting officer determines that the information obtained through 
market research pursuant to paragraph ( 1) of this section  is insufficient to determine 
the reasonableness of price, the contracting officer must  consider information submitted 
by the offeror of recent purchase prices paid by the Government and commercial customers for the same or similar commercial products or commercial services  under 
comparable terms and conditions in establishing price reasonableness on a subsequent purchase if the contracting officer is satisfied that the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison.  In assessing whether the prices previously paid remain a valid reference for comparison, the contracting officer must  consider the totality of 
other relevant factors such as the time elapsed since the prior purchase and any differences in the quantities purchased (10 U.S.C. 3703(e )). 
   (3 )  If the contracting officer determines that the offeror cannot provide 
sufficient information as described in paragraph ( 2) of this section to determine the 
reasonableness of price, the contracting officer should request the offeror to submit information on — 
    (i )  Prices paid for the same or similar items sold under different terms and 
conditions;  
    ( ii)  Prices paid for similar levels of work or effort on related products or 
services;  
    ( iii)  Prices paid for alternative solutions or approaches; and 
    ( iv)  Other relevant information that can serve as the basis for determining 
the reasonableness of price.  
   (4 )  The contracting officer is not restricted from requiring the contractor to 
supply sufficient information to determine the reasonableness of price, regardless of 
whether or not the contractor was required to provide such information in connection with any earlier procurement.  If the contracting officer determines that the pricing information submi tted is not sufficient to determine the reasonableness of price, the 
contracting officer should request other information regarding the basis for price or c ost, 
including uncertified cost or pricing data such as labor costs, material costs, and other 
direct and indirect costs.</pre>
