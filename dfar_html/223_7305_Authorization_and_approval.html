    <h1>223.7305 Authorization and approval</h1>
    <pre>(a) The prohibition in 223.7303 does not apply to critical defense applications if no 
substitute can meet performance requirements. The DoD policy of April 8, 2009, 
“Minimizing the Use of Hexavalent Chromium,” contains requirements for weighing 
use of hexavalent chromium versus substitutes. DoD Program Managers must consider 
the following  factors — 
   (1) Cost effectiveness of alternative materials or processes;  
   (2) Technical feasibility of alternative materials or processes;  
   (3) Environment, safety, and occupational health risks associated with the use 
of the hexavalent chromium or substitute materials in each specific application;  
   (4) Achieving a DoD Manufacturing Readiness Level of at least eight for any 
qualified alternative;  
   (5) Materiel availability of hexavalent chromium and the proposed alternatives 
over the projected life span of the system; and  
DARS Tracking Number : 2026- O0018 
 23 
  (6) Corrosion performance difference of alternative materials or processes as 
determined by agency corrosion subject matter experts.  
  (b) However, unless an exception in 223.7304 applies, the incorporation of 
hexavalent chromium in items acquired by DoD must be specifically authorized at a 
level no lower than a general or flag officer or a member of the Senior Executive Service from the Program Executive Office or equivalent level, in coordination  with the 
component Corrosion Control and Prevention Executive. Follow the procedures in PGI 223.7305.</pre>
