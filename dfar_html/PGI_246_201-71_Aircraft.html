    <h1>PGI 246.201-71 Aircraft</h1>
    <pre>(a)  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has certain responsibilities and 
prerogatives in connection with some commercial aircraft and of aircraft equipment and accessories (Pub. L. 85- 726 (72 Stat 776, 49 U.S.C. 1423)).  This includes the issuance 
of various certificates applicable to design, manufacture, and airworthiness.  
 2026- O0035  
  (b)  FAA evaluations are not a substitute for normal DoD evaluations of the 
contractor&#x27;s quality assurance measures.  Actual records of FAA evaluations may be of 
use to the contract administration office (CAO) and should be used to their maximum advantage.  
 
 (c)  The CAO must ensure that the contractor possesses any required FAA 
certificates prior to acceptance.  In addition, ensure that — 
   (i)  A detailed consultation with the FAA Military Certification Office (MCO) 
(contact the MCO here: https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/air/hq/compliance
_airworthiness_air700/mco is documented regarding the scope of the acquisition or 
modification project;  
 
  (ii)  Supporting contractual documents (meeting minutes, an email record of 
consultations, memoranda, etc.) demonstrate that the scope of work is feasible and compatible with FAA regulations and policy;  
 
  (iii)  The period of performance and contract deliverable dates are consistent 
with FAA capabilities; and  
 
  (iv)  Contract provisions requiring FAA approval or processes are coordinated 
with the MCO prior to a solicitation.</pre>
