    <h1>219.104-70 Set asides for religious -related services</h1>
    <pre>(a)  When acquiring religious -related services for a U.S. military base, allow 
nonprofit organizations to compete on set -asides for small business concerns and avoid 
using sole -source exceptions . 
  (b)  If the apparently successful offeror does not identify as a small business, verify 
that it is registered in SAM as a nonprofit organization.  
  (c)  Insert the provision at 252.219- 7012, Competition for Religious -Related Services, 
in solicitations, including solicitations using FAR part 12 procedures for the acquisition of commercial services, for religious -related services to be performed on U.S. military 
installations, when the acquisition is set aside for any of the small business concerns identified in FAR 19.000(a)(3).</pre>
