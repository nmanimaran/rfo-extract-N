    <h1>223.7102 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(a) 10 U.S.C. 2692 prohibits storage, treatment, or disposal on DoD installations of 
toxic or hazardous materials that are not owned either by DoD or by a member of the armed forces (or a dependent of the member) assigned to or provided military housing on the installation, unless an exception in 223.7104 applies.  
  (b) When storage of toxic or hazardous materials is authorized based on an 
imminent danger, the storage provided must  be temporary and must cease once the 
imminent danger no longer exists. In all other cases of storage or disposal, the storage or disposal must  be terminated as determined by the Secretary of Defense.</pre>
