    <h1>217.7404-4 Limitations on obligations</h1>
    <pre>(a)  The Government must  not obligate more than 50 percent of the not -to-exceed 
price before definitization.  However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal before 50 percent of the not -to-exceed price has been obligated by the Government, then 
the limitation on obligation s before definitization may be increased to no more than 75 
percent (see 232.102 -70 for coverage on provisional delivery payments).  
  (b)  In determining the appropriate amount to obligate, the contracting officer will 
assess the contractor’s proposal for the undefinitized period and will  obligate funds only 
in an amount consistent with the contractor’s requirements for the undefinitized period.
