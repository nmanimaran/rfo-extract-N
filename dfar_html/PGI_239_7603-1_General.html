    <pre>(a)  When the apparently successful offeror indicates in the provision at 
DFARS 252.239- 7009
 that cloud computing services will be used in the performance of 
the contract, the contracting officer must  review the DoD Cloud Service Catalog at 
http://www.disa.mil/Computing/Cloud -Services/Cloud -Support (look under the 
“Additional Information” tab for “Service Catalog”) to verify that the cloud service provider’s offering to be used in the performance of the contract has a provisional authorization prior to award (see DFARS  
239.7602-1 (b)). 
  (b)  When the contractor indicated in the provision at DFARS  252.239- 7009
 that it 
did not anticipate the use of cloud computing services in the performance of the contract and requests, after award, in accordance with the clause at DFARS  
252.239- 7010 (b)(1), 
that the contracting officer approve the use of cloud computing services in the performance of the contract, the contracting officer must — 
   (1)  Request approval from the requiring activity for the contractor to use cloud 
computing services; and    (2)  If the requiring activity provides approval, review the DoD Cloud Service 
Catalog at http://www.disa.mil/Computing/Cloud -Services/Cloud -Support (look under the 
“Additional Information” tab for “Service Catalog”) to verify that the cloud service provider’s offering to be used in the performance of the contract has a provisional authorization (see DFARS 239.7602-1
(b)).</pre>
