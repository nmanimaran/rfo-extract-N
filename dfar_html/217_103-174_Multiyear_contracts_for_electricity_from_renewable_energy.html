    <pre>sources.  
 
 (a)  The head of the contracting activity may enter into a contract for a period not to 
exceed 10 years for the purchase of electricity from sources of renewable energy, as that 
term is defined in section 203(b)(2) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. 
15852(b)(2)).  
  (b)  The head of the contracting activity may exercise the authority in paragraph (a) 
of this section to enter into a contract for a period in excess of five years only if the head of the contracting activity determines, on the basis of a business case analysi s prepared 
by the requiring activity, that — 
   (1)  The proposed purchase of electricity under such contract is cost effective; 
and 
   (2)  It would not be possible to purchase electricity from the source in an 
economical manner without the use of a contract for a period in excess of five years.  
 
 (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the DoD from using other 
multiyear contracting authority of DoD to purchase renewable energy.  
  (d)  See PGI 217.103- 174 for a business case analysis template and guidance.</pre>
