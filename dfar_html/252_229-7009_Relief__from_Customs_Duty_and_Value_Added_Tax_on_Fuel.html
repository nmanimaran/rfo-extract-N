 As prescribed in  229.402- 70(i), use the following clause:  
  
RELIEF FROM CUSTOMS DUTY AND VALUE ADDED TAX ON FUEL 
(PASSENGER VEHICLES) (UNITED KINGDOM) (JUN 1997)  
  
      (a)  Pursuant to an agreement between the United States Government and Her 
Majesty’s (HM) Customs and Excise, fuels and lubricants used by passenger vehicles (except taxis) in the performance of this contract will be exempt from customs duty and value added tax.   Therefore, the procedures outlined in HM Customs and Excise Notice 
No. 431B, August 1982, and any amendment thereto, shall be used to obtain relief from both customs duty and value added tax for fuel used under the contract.   These 
procedures  shall apply to both loaded and unloaded miles.   The unit prices shall be 
based on the  recoupment by the Contractor of customs duty in accordance with the 
following allowances:  
                (1)   Vehicles (except taxis) with a seating capacity of less than 29, one gallon for 
every 27 miles.  
                (2)   Vehicles with a seating capacity of 29 -53, one gallon for every 13 miles.  
                (3)   Vehicles with a seating capacity of 54 or more, one gallon for every  
10 miles.  
        (b)  In the event the mileage of any route is increased or decreased within 10 
percent, resulting in no change in route price, the customs duty shall be reclaimed from HM Customs and Excise on actual mileage performed.
