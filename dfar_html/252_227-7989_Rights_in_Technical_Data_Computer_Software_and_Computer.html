 46 
 line item of data (as identified in DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List)

  (c)  Contractor notification .  The Contractor agrees to notify the Contracting 
Officer in writing immediately of any breach of the above warranty which the Contractor discovers within the warranty period.  
  (d)  Remedies.   The following remedies shall apply to all breaches of the 
warranty, whether the Contractor notifies the Contracting Officer in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause or if the Government notifies the Contractor of the breach in writing within the war ranty period:  
   (1)  Within a reasonable time after such notification, the Contracting Officer 
may— 
    (i)  By written notice, direct the Contractor to correct or replace at the 
Contractor&#x27;s expense the nonconforming technical data promptly; or  
    (ii)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the Government no longer 
has a requirement for correction or replacement of the data, or that the data can be more reasonably corrected by the Government, inform the Contractor by written notice that the Government elects a price or fee adjustment instead of correction or replacement.  
   (2)  If the Contractor refuses or fails to comply with a direction under 
paragraph (d) (1)(i) of this clause, the Contracting Officer may, within a reasonable time of the refusal or failure—     (i)  By contract or otherwise, correct or replace the nonconforming 
technical data and charge the cost to the Contractor; or     (ii)  Elect a price or fee adjustment instead of correction or replacement.  
   (3)  The remedies in this clause represent the only way to enforce the 
Government&#x27;s rights under this clause.  
  (e)  The provisions of this clause apply anew to that portion of any corrected or 
replaced technical data furnished to the Government under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this clause.
