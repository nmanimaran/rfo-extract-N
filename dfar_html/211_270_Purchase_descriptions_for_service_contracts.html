    <h1>211.270 Purchase descriptions for service contracts</h1>
    <pre>To partially implement section 831 of FY 2009 NDAA  (Pub. L. 110-417), agencies

contracts  include language to provide a clear distinction between Government 
employees and contractor employees  as follows:  
  (a)  Agencies must  be guided by the characteristics and descriptive elements of 
personal -services contracts.  
  (b)  Service contracts must  require contractor employees to identify themselves 
as contractor personnel by introducing themselves or being introduced as contractor personnel and displaying distinguishing badges or other visible identification for meetings with Government personnel.  
  (c)  Services c ontracts must  require contractor personnel to appropriately 
identify themselves as contractor employees in telephone conversations and in formal and informal written correspondence.</pre>
