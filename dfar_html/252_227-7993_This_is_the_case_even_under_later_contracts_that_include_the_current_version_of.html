    <h1>252.227-7993 This is the case even under later contracts that include the current version of</h1>
    <pre>the clause at DFARS 252.227 -7993  with a non -extendable 20 -year SBIR/STTR data 
protection period.  In addition, the SBIR data protection period from the prior version of the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7993  may be extended indefinitely for subsequent redeliveries of 
identical SBIR data as long as the SBIR project has not been completed.  
 
  (ii)  SBIR data first delivered with the 20- year SBIR data protection period and later 
redelivered under the current SBIR clause.  In another example, a contractor generates and delivers SBIR data under a 2021 phase II SBIR contract.  The contractor delivers identical data under a later phase III contract that is an extension of the research effort in the 2021 contract.  The contractor asserts SBIR data rights in these data.  That 2021 contract included a version of the DFARS 252.227- 7993 clause that defines the SBIR data protection 
period as the period commencing on the date of contract award and ending 20 years after that date.  The same definition of the SBIR/STTR data protection period applies to the redelivered SBIR data in the later phase III contract.  Redelivery of identical SBIR data under 
any later contract will not extend the 20- year SBIR data protection period.  
  (2)  Modifications to previously delivered SBIR or STTR data.  A contractor generates 
and delivers SBIR/STTR data under a phase II STTR contract with the current version of the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7993 .  The contractor develops and delivers modified STTR data 
under a later phase III contract.  The contractor asserts SBIR/STTR data rights in these data.  The previously delivered portions of the STTR data will be governed by the previous SBIR/STTR data pr otection period, while the newly developed portions of the STTR data will 
be governed by a new 20- year SBIR/STTR data protection period.  
  (3)  SBIR or STTR data delivered under a contract and the contractor was not awarded a 
SBIR or STTR contract .  A subcontractor was awarded a SBIR phase I contract.  Later, the 
subcontractor performed SBIR phase III work under a contract awarded to a contractor who 
 2026- O0036  
 was not awarded a SBIR or STTR contract.  The subcontractor furnished technical data and 
computer software deliverables related to SBIR phase III work performed under this contract.  This technical data and computer software was furnished to the Government  with 
SBIR data rights.  The clause at DFARS 252.227 -7993 should have been included either in 
the initial contract or via a contract modification, and the Government’s rights in this SBIR data are subject to the terms of the clause at DFAR S 252.227- 7993.</pre>
