    <pre>(a)  Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy  peer reviews . 
   (1)  The Office of the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and 
Acquisition Policy (DPCAP), using the procedures in this section, will organize teams of reviewers and facilitate peer reviews for solicitations and contracts as follows:  
    (i)  DPCAP will conduct the p reaward peer reviews for competitive procurements 
prior to the three phases of the acquisition (see PGI 201.170-2 (a)) for all procurements with 
an estimated value of $1 billion or more under major defense acquisition programs for which USD(A&amp;S) is the milestone decision authority or USD(A&amp;S) designates as requiring a peer review regardless of value.  DoD components m ay request DPCAP -led peer reviews for 
acquisitions valued below the $1 billion threshold.  DPCAP will conduct these reviews upon approval by the Direc tor, DPCAP (Contract Policy).  
    (ii)  DPCAP will conduct the preaward peer reviews for noncompetitive 
procurements prior to the  two phases of the acquisition (see PGI 201.170-2 (b)) for contract 
actions, e.g., new contracts, modifications to existing contracts, requests for equitable adjustment, claims valued at $1 billion or more, or for any other contract action USD(A&amp;S) designates as requiring a peer review regardless of value.  DoD components may request DPCAP- led peer reviews for contract actions valued below the $1 billion threshold.  DPCAP 
will conduct these reviews upon approval by the Director, DPCAP (Price, Cost and Finance).  
    (iii)  Use the following criteria to identify actions that are subject to peer review:  
     (A)  If the not -to-exceed amount for an undefinitized contract action or an 
unpriced change order exceeds the peer review threshold, then the result ing definitization 
modification(s) will be subject to peer review regardless of actual performance up to the point of definitization.  
     (B)  For indefinite -delivery indefinite- quantity (IDIQ) contracts that will 
establish pricing terms that apply to orders, use the total maximum dollar value for purposes of the peer review threshold.  IDIQ contracts that will not establish pricing terms in the basic 
 2026 -O0002  
 contract are not subject to peer review, but individual orders that exceed the threshold are 
subject to peer review.  
     (C)  For noncompetitive contract actions, use the greater of the following 
when considering the firm requirement for all supplies or services:  
      (1)  The approved Government objective amount.  
      (2)  The contractor proposed amount.  
   (2)  To facilitate planning for peer reviews, the military departments and defense 
agencies must provide a rolling annual forecast of acquisitions that will be subject to DPCAP 
peer reviews at the end of each quarter (i.e., March 31; June 30; September 30; December 31). 
    (i)  Military departments and defense agencies must submit quarterly forecasts 
for competitive peer reviews to the Director, DPCAP (Contract Policy), at osd.pentagon.ousd- a-s.mbx.dpc -cp@mail.mil.  
    (ii)  Military departments and defense agencies must  submit quarterly forecasts 
for noncompetitive peer reviews to the Director, DPCAP (Price, Cost and Finance), at osd.pentagon.ousd- a-s.mbx.dpc -pcf-peer-reviews@mail.mil.  
  (b)  Component peer reviews .  The military departments and defense agencies must 
establish procedures for — 
   (1)  Preaward peer reviews of solicitations for competitive procurements not subject 
to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section ; and  
 
  (2)  Preaward peer reviews of noncompetitive procurements not subject to 
paragraph (a)(1)(ii)  of this section . 
  (c)  DoD components may request a DPC AP-led peer review for procurements that 
would not otherwise require a DPC AP-led peer review.  
 
 (d)  Military departments and defense agencies must , on or about June 30 and 
December 31 of each year, submit recommended best practices and lessons learned from 
competitive acquisition peer reviews under major defense acquisition programs to osd.pentagon.ousd- a-s.mbx.dpc -cp@mail.mil.  Submissions that have broad applicability 
may be selected for posting at https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/policy/competitive -
