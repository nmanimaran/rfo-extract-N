    <h1>252.227-7997 Validation of Asserted Restrictions.   (DEVIATION 2026 -O0036)</h1>
    <pre>As prescribed in 227.7103 -6(g), 227.7104- 4(b)(6), or 227.7203- 6(c), use the following 
clause:  
 
VALIDATION OF ASSERTED RESTRICTIONS (DEVIATION 2026 -O0036 ) 
(FEB 2026)  
  (a)  Definitions.   The terms used in this clause are defined in the 252.227 -7989, 
Rights in Technical Data, Computer Software, and Computer Software Documentation —Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, clause of 
this contract.  
  (b)  Technical data related  to commercial products or commercial services—
presumption regarding development exclusively at private expense.  For technical data 
related  to commercial products or commercial services, the Contracting Officer will 
presume that the Contractor ’s or a subcontractor’ s asserted use or release restrictions 
with respect to a commercial product or commercial service are justified on the basis that the item was developed exclusively at private expense.  The Contracting Officer 
will not  issue a challenge unless there are reasonable grounds to question the validity of 
the assertion that the commercial item was developed exclusively at private expense.  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
    (c)  Justification.   The Contractor or subcontractor at any tier is responsible for 
maintaining records sufficient to justify the validity of its asserted restrictions on the 
rights of the Government and others to use, duplicate, release, or disclose technical data 
or computer software delivered, required to be delivered, or otherwise provided to the 
Government under the contract or subcontract.  Except as provided in paragraph (b) of 
this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall be prepared to furnis h to the 
Contracting Officer a written justification for such asserted restrictions in response to a challenge under paragraph (e) of this clause.  
  (d)  Prechallenge request for information related to asserted restrictions on technical 
data.   (1)  The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor or subcontractor to 
furnish a written explanation for any asserted restriction on the right of the United States or others to use, disclose, or release technical data.  If, upon review of the 
explanation submitted, the Contracting Officer cannot determine the basis of the asserted restriction, the Contracting Officer may further request the Contractor or subcontractor to furnish additional information in the records of, or otherwise in the 
possession of or reasonably available to, the Contractor or subcontractor to justify the validity of any asserted restriction on technical data delivered, to be delivered, or otherwise provided to the Government under the contract or subcontract ( e.g., a 
statement of facts accompanied with supporting documentation).  The Contractor or 
subcontractor shall submit such written data as requested by the Contracting Officer within the time required or such longer period as may be mutually agreed.  
   (2)  If the Contracting Officer, after reviewing the written data furnished 
pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, or any other available information related  to 
the validity of an asserted restriction, determines that reasonable grounds exist to question the current validity of the asserted restriction and that continued adherence to the asserted restriction would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item or process to which the technical data relates, the Contracting 
Officer will follow the procedures in paragraph (f) of this clause.  
   (3)  If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond to the Contracting 
Officer ’s request for information under paragraph (d)(1) of this clause, and the 
Contracting Officer determines that continued adherence to the asserted restriction would make impracticable the subsequent competitive acquisition of the item or process to which the  technical data relates, the Contracting Officer may challenge the validity of 
the asserted restriction as described in paragraph (f) of this clause.  
  (e)  Prechallenge request for information related to assertion restrictions on computer 
software.  (1)  The Contracting Officer may request the Contractor to provide sufficient 
information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor ’s asserted 
restrictions.  Such information shall be based upon the records required by this clause 
or other information reasonably available to the Contractor.  
   (2)  Based upon the information provided, if the — 
    (i)  Contractor agrees that an asserted restriction is not valid, the 
Contracting Officer may — 
     (A)  Strike or correct the unjustified marking at the Contractor’ s 
expense; or  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
    (B)  Return the computer software to the Contractor for correction at the 
Contractor’ s expense.  If the Contractor fails to correct or strike the unjustified marking 
and return the corrected software to the Contracting Officer within 60 days following 
receipt of the software, the Contracting Officer may correct or strike the marking at the 
Contractor’ s expense;  
    (ii)  Contracting Officer concludes that the asserted restriction is appropriate 
for this contract, the Contracting Officer shall so notify the Contractor in writing.  
   (3)  The Contractor ’s failure to provide a timely response to a Contracting 
Officer ’s request for information or failure to provide sufficient information to enable the 
Contracting Officer to evaluate an asserted restriction shall constitute reasonable grounds for questioning the validity of an asserted restriction.  
  (f)  Challenge.   (1)  Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning 
inspection and acceptance, if the Contracting Officer determines that a challenge to the asserted restriction is warranted, the Contracting Officer will send a written challenge notice to the Contra ctor or subcontractor making the asserted restriction.  The 
challenge notice and all related correspondence shall be subject to handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information.  Such challenge w ill— 
    (i)  State the specific grounds for challenging the asserted restriction 
including, for technical data related  to commercial products or commercial services, 
sufficient information to reasonably demonstrate that the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense;  
    (ii)  Require a response within 60 days justifying the assertion based upon 
records kept in accordance with paragraph (c) of this clause and providing sufficient 
evidence as to the current validity of the asserted restriction;  
    (iii)  State that a Contracting Officer ’s final decision, issued pursuant to 
paragraph (h) of this clause, or action of a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals that sustained the validity of an identical assertion made by the Contractor (or a licensee) sustaining the valid ity of a prior asserted restriction identical 
to the current asserted restriction, within the 3 -year period preceding the current 
challenge, shall serve as justification for the current asserted restriction if the  prior 
validated restriction was asserted by the same Contractor or subcontractor (or any licensee of such Contractor or subcontractor) to which such notice is being provided; and     (iv)  State that failure to respond to the challenge notice may result in 
issuance of a final decision pursuant to paragraph (g) of this clause.  
   (2)  The Contracting Officer will extend the time for response as appropriate if 
the Contractor or subcontractor submits a written request showing the need for additional time to prepare a response.  
   (3)  The Contractor ’s or subcontractor’ s written response shall be considered  a 
claim within the meaning of the 41 U.S.C. 7101, Contract Disputes, and shall be certified in the form prescribed at 33.207 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, regardless of dollar amount.  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
  (4)  A Contractor or subcontractor receiving challenges to the same asserted 
restrictions from more than one Contracting Officer shall notify each Contracting Officer of the existence of more than one challenge.  The notice shall also state which 
Contracting Officer initiated the first in time unanswered challenge.  The Contracting 
Officer initiating the first in time unanswered challenge after consultation with the Contractor or subcontractor and the other Contracting Officers, will formulate and distrib ute a schedule for responding to each of the challenge notices to all interested 
parties.  The schedule will afford the Contractor or subcontractor a reasonable 
opportunity to respond to each challenge notice.  All parties will be bound by this 
schedule.  
   (5)  The Contracting Officer may request additional supporting documentation 
if, in the Contracting Officer ’s opinion, the Contractor ’s explanation does not provide 
sufficient evidence to justify the validity of the asserted restrictions.  The Contractor 
agrees to promptly respond to the Contracting Officer’ s request for additional 
supporting documentation.  
   (6)  Notwithstanding challenge by the Contracting Officer, the parties may 
agree on the disposition of an asserted restriction at any time prior to a Contracting Officer ’s final decision or, if the Contractor has appealed that decision, filed suit, or 
provided notice of an intent to file suit, at any time prior to a decision by a court of competent jurisdiction or Board of Contract Appeals.  
  (g)  Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor fails to respond.   Upon a failure 
of a Contractor or subcontractor to submit any response to the challenge notice or a request for additional information (under paragraphs (f)(1) and (f)(5) of this clause), the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contracto r or subcontractor in 
accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract.  In order to sustain the challenge 
for commercial products or commercial services, the Contracting Officer will provide information demonstrating that the commercial prod uct or commercial service was not 
developed exclusively at private expense.  This final decision will be issued as soon as 
possible after the expiration of the time period of paragraph ( f)(1)(ii) or (f)(2) of this 
clause.  Following issuance of the final decision, the Contracting Officer will comply 
with the procedures in paragraphs (h)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this clause.  
  (h)  Final decision when Contractor or subcontractor responds.   (1)  If the 
Contracting Officer determines that the Contractor or subcontractor has justified the validity of the asserted restriction, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor that sustains the validity of the asse rted restriction and 
that states that the Government will continue to be bound by the asserted restriction.  The Contracting Officer will issue this final decision within 60 days after r eceipt of the 
Contractor’ s or subcontractor’ s response to the challenge notice, or within such longer 
period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.  The Contracting Officer will provide notification of any longer 
period for issuance of a final decision within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.  
   (2)(i)  If the Contracting Officer determines that the validity of the asserted 
restriction is not justified, the Contracting Officer will issue a final decision to the Contractor or subcontractor in accordance with the Disputes clause of this contract.  To 
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
   sustain the challenge for technical data related  to commercial products or commercial 
services, the Contracting Officer will provide information demonstrating that the 
commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private 
expense.  Notwithstanding paragraph (e) of the Disputes clause, the final decision will 
be issued within 60 days after receipt of the Contractor ’s or subcontractor’ s response to 
the challenge notice, or within such longer period that the Contracting Officer has notified the Contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.  The 
notification of a longer period for issuance of a final decision will be made within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.  
    (ii)  The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the asserted 
restriction for a period of 90 days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer’ s final 
decision under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this clause.  The Contractor or subcontractor 
agrees that, if it intends to file suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, it will provide a notice of intent to file suit to the Contracting Officer within 90 days from the issuance of the Contracting Officer ’s final decision under paragraph (h)( 2)(i) of this 
clause.  If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to appeal to an  agency Board of Contract 
Appeals, file suit in an appropriate court, or provide a notice of intent to file suit in an appropriate court to the Contracting Officer within the 90 -day period, the Government 
may cancel or ignore the restrictive markings that are based on the asserted restrictions, and the failure of the Contractor or subcontractor to take the required action constitutes agreement with such Government action.  
    (iii)  The Government agrees that it will continue to be bound by the 
asserted restriction where a notice of intent to file suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims is provided to the Contracting Officer within 90 days from the issuance of the final deci sion under paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this clause.  The Government will no 
longer be bound, and the Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Government may strike or ignore the restrictive marking that is based on the asserted restriction, if the 
Contractor or subcontractor fails to file its suit within 1 year after issuance of the final decision.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency determines, on a 
nondelegable basis, that urgent or compelling circumstances will not permit waiting for the filing of a suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, the Contractor or subcont ractor agrees that the agency may, following notice to the Contractor or 
subcontractor, authorize release or disclosure of the technical data or compute r 
software.  The Government agrees not to release or disclose such technical data or 
computer software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and nondisclosure agreement at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 227.7103 -7, or is a Government contractor receiving access to the 
technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7994 , Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of 
Government -Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.  Such agency 
determination may be made at any time after issuance of the final decision and will not affect the Contractor ’s or subcontractor’ s right to damages against the United States 
where its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.   
    (iv)  The Government agrees that it will be bound by the asserted 
restrictions where an appeal or suit is filed pursuant to the Contract Disputes statute until final disposition by an agency Board of Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the head of an agency 
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
   determines, on a nondelegable basis, following notice to the Contractor that urgent or 
compelling circumstances will not permit awaiting the decision by such Board of 
Contract Appeals or the United States Court of Federal Claims, the Contractor or 
subcontr actor agrees that the agency may authorize release or disclosure of the 
technical data or computer software.  The Government agrees not to release or disclose 
such technical data or computer software unless, prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use and nondisclosure agreement at Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 227.7103 -7, or is a Government contractor 
receiving access to the technical data or computer software for performance of a Government cont ract that contains the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7994 , Limitations on 
the Use or Disclosure of Government -Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive 
Legends.  Such agency determination may be made at any time after issuance of the 
final decision and will not affect the Contractor ’s or subcontractor’ s right to damages 
against the United States where its asserted restrictions are ultimately upheld or to pursue other relief, if any, as may be provided by law.  
  (i)  Final disposition of appeal or suit.   (1)  If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals 
or files suit and if, upon final disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer ’s 
decision is sustained — 
    (i)  The restrictive marking that is based on the asserted restriction on the 
technical data or computer software shall be cancelled, corrected or ignored; and     (ii)  If the asserted restriction is found not to be substantially justified, the 
Contractor or subcontractor, as appropriate, shall be liable to the Government for payment of the cost to the Government of reviewing the asserted restriction and the fees and othe r expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Government 
in challenging the asserted restriction, unless special circumstances would make such payment unjust.  
   (2)  If the Contractor or subcontractor appeals or files suit and if, upon final 
disposition of the appeal or suit, the Contracting Officer’ s decision is not sustained — 
    (i)  The Government will continue to be bound by the restrictive marking; 
and 
    (ii)  The Government will be liable to the Contractor or subcontractor for 
payment of fees and other expenses (as defined in 28 U.S.C. 2412(d)(2)(A)) incurred by the Contractor or subcontractor in defending the marking, if the challenge by the Government is foun d not to have been made in good faith.  
  (j)  Duration of right to challenge.   (1)  The Government may review the validity of 
any restriction on technical data or computer software, delivered or that the Contractor must deliver  under a contract, asserted by the Contractor or subcontractor.  During the 
period within 6 years of final payment on a contract or within 6 years of delivery of the technical data or computer software to the Government, whichever is later, the Contracting Officer may review and make a written determination to challenge  the 
restriction.  The Government may, however, challenge a restriction on the release, 
disclosure, or use of technical data or computer software at any time if such technical data or computer software — 
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
      (i)  Are publicly available;  
 
   (ii)  Have been furnished to the United States without restriction;  
 
   (iii)  Have been otherwise made available without restriction; or  
 
   (iv)  Are the subject of a fraudulently asserted use or release restriction.  
   (2)  Only the Contracting Officer ’s final decision resolving a formal challenge by 
sustaining the validity of a restrictive marking or actions of an agency Board of Contract Appeals or a court of competent jurisdiction that sustain the validity of an asserted restriction constitute “valida tion” as addressed in 10 U.S.C. 3785(c).  
  (k)  Decision not to challenge.   A decision by the Government, or a determination by 
the Contracting Officer, to not challenge the restrictive marking or asserted restriction shall not constitute “validation.”  
  (l)  Privity of contract.   The Contractor or subcontractor agrees that the Contracting 
Officer may transact matters under this clause directly with subcontractors at any tier that assert restrictions.  However, this clause neither creates nor implies privity of 
contract between the Government and subcontractor.  
  (m)  Flowdown.   The Contractor or subcontractor agrees to insert this clause in 
contractual instruments, including subcontracts and other contractual instruments for commercial products or commercial services, with its subcontractors or suppliers at any tier requiring the  delivery of technical data or computer software.  The clause may not 
be altered other than to identify the appropriate parties.
