    <h1>252.219-7000 Advancing Small Business Growth</h1>
    <pre>As prescribed in 219.170(a), use the following provision:  
 ADVANCING SMALL BUSINESS GROWTH ( JUN 2023 ) 
  (a)  This provision implements 10 U.S.C. 4959.  
  (b)  The Offeror acknowledges by submission of its offer that by acceptance of the 
contract resulting from this solicitation, the Offeror may exceed the applicable small business size standard of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to the contract and would no longer qualify as a small business concern 
for that NAICS code.  Small business size standards matched to industry NAICS codes 
 2026- O0037  
 are published by the Small Business Administration and are available at 13 CFR 
121.201 and https://www.sba.gov/document/support -table -size-standards.  The Offeror 
is therefore encouraged to develop the capabilities and characteristics typically desired in contractors that are competitive as other -than- small contractors in this industry.  
  (c)  For procurement technical assistance, the Offeror may contact the nearest APEX 
Accelerator.  APEX Accelerator locations are available at https://www.apexaccelerators.us.
