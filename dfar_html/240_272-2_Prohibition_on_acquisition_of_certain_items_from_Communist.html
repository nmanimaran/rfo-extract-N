    <pre>Chinese military companies.  
This section implements section 1211 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Pub. L. 109- 163), section 1243 of the National Defense 
 2026- O0025 
 40 
 Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Pub. L. 112- 81), and section 1296 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Pub. L. 114- 328).   See PGI 
240.272-2 for additional information relating to this statute, the terms used in this 
section, the United States Munitions List (USML), and the 600 series of the 
Commerce Control List (CCL).  
  (a)  Definitions.  As used in this section — 
  “Component” means an item that is useful only when used in conjunction with 
an end item (15 CFR 772.1 and 22 CFR 120.45(b)).  
  “Item” means — 
   (1)  A USML defense article, as defined at 22 CFR 120.6;  
   (2)  A USML defense service, as defined at 22 CFR 120.9; or  
   (3)  A 600 series item, as defined at 15 CFR 772.1.  
  “Part” means any single unassembled element of a major or minor component, 
accessory, or attachment, that is not normally subject to disassembly without the destruction or impairment of designed use (15 CFR 772.1 and 22 CFR 120.45(d)).  
  (b)  Prohibition .  Do not acquire items covered by the USML or the 600 series of 
the CCL, through a contract or subcontract at any tier, from any Communist 
Chinese military company .  This prohibition does not apply to components and 
parts of covered items unless the components and parts are themselves covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL.  
  (c)  Exceptions.   The prohibition in paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to 
items acquired — 
   (1)  In connection with a visit to the People’s Republic of China by a vessel or 
an aircraft of the U.S. armed forces;  
   (2)  For testing purposes; or  
   (3)  For the purpose of gathering intelligence.  
  (d)  Identifying items covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL.  
   (1)  Before issuance of a solicitation, the requiring activity will notify the 
contracting officer in writing whether the items to be acquired are covered by the USML or the 600 series of the CCL. The notification will identify any covered item(s) and will provide the pertinent USML reference(s) from 22 CFR part 121 or the 600 series of the CCL references from 15 CFR part 774, Supplement No. 1.  
   (2)  The USML includes defense articles and defense services that fall into 
21 categories.  The CCL includes ten categories and five product groups in each 
category, many of which contain 600 series items .  Since not all items covered by the 
 2026- O0025 
 40 
 USML or 600 series of the CCL are themselves munitions (e.g., protective personnel 
equipment, military training equipment), the requiring activity should consult the USML and the 600 series of the CCL before concluding that an item is or is not covered.  See PGI 2 40.272-2(d). 
  (e)  Waiver of prohibition.  
   (1)  The prohibition in paragraph (b) of this section may be waived, on a 
case-by-case basis, if an official identified in paragraph (b) of this section 
determines that a waiver is necessary for national security purposes.  
   (2)  The following officials are authorized, without power of delegation, to 
make the determination specified in paragraph (a) of this section:  
    (i)  The Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment).  
    (ii)  The Secretaries of the military departments.  
    (iii)  The Component Acquisition Executive of the Defense Logistics 
Agency.  
   (3)(i)  The official granting a waiver must  submit a report to the 
congressional defense committees, with a copy to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (see PGI 2 40.272- 2), not less than 15 
days before issuing the waiver.  
    (ii)  In the report, the official must — 
     (A)  Identify the specific reasons for the waiver; and  
     (B)  Include recommendations as to what actions may be taken to 
develop alternative sourcing capabilities in the future.  
  (f)  Contract clause .  Unless an exception in  paragraph (c) of this section applies, 
insert  the clause at  252.225- 7007 , Prohibition on Acquisition of Certain Items from 
Communist Chinese Military Companies, in solicitations and contracts, including solicitations and contracts using  FAR part 12  procedures for the acquisition of 
commercial products and commercial services, involving the delivery of items covered by the United States Munitions List or the 600 series of the Commerce Control List.</pre>
