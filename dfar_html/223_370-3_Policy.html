    <h1>223.370-3 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(a) DoD policy is to ensure that its contractors take reasonable precautions in 
handling ammunition and explosives so as to minimize the potential for mishaps.  
DARS Tracking Number : 2026- O0018 
 23 
   (b) DoD Manual 4145.26, DoD Contractors&#x27; Safety Manual for Ammunition and 
Explosives  implements this policy , and it contains mandatory safety requirements for 
contractors . Contracts under which ammunition and explosives are handled  must 
reflect this policy .  
 
 (c) When work is to be performed on a Government -owned installation, the 
contracting officer may use the ammunition and explosives regulation of the DoD component or installation as a substitute for, or supplement  to, DoD Manual 4145.26, 
as long as the contract cites the ammunition and explosives regulation of the DoD component or installation.</pre>
