    <h1>PGI 207.171 Component breakout</h1>
    <pre>DoD policy is to break out components of weapons systems or other major end items under certain circumstances.  
  (a)  When it is anticipated that a prime contract will be awarded without adequate price 
competition, and the prime contractor is expected to acquire any component without adequate price competition, the agency must  break out that component if — 
 2026- O0020  
   (1)  Substantial net cost savings probably will be achieved; and  
 
  (2)  Breakout action will not jeopardize the quality, reliability, performance, or timely 
delivery of the end item.  
  (b)  Even when either or both the prime contract and the component will be acquired with 
adequate price competition, the agency must  consider breakout of the component if 
substantial net cost savings will result from — 
   (1)  Greater quantity acquisitions; or  
   (2)  Such factors as improved logistics support (through reduction in varieties of 
spare parts) and economies in operations and training (through standardization of design).  
 
 (c)  Breakout normally is not justified for a component that is not expected to exceed $1 
million for the current year&#x27;s requirement.</pre>
