mobilization at the work site.  
   (2)  The remaining ______ percent upon completion of demobilization.

   (1)  Failure to justify such price to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer will 
result in payment, as determined by the Contracting Officer, of — 
    (i)  Actual mobilization costs at completion of mobilization;  
    (ii)  Actual demobilization costs at completion of demobilization; and  
    (iii)  The remainder of this item in the final payment under this contract.
