    <h1>219.108-1 General</h1>
    <pre>(d)(i)  The SBA has delegated its authority under 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1) to the Under 
Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Sustainment) to award 8(a) contracts to eligible 8(a) participants.  This delegation, based on a Partnership Agreement (PA) between the 
SBA and DoD, redelegates this authority to DoD contracting officers and only covers contract signing on the SBA&#x27;s behalf.  The SBA remains the prime contractor, 
determines eligibility, and retains appeal rights.  The PA, including its expiration date, 
is available at PGI 219.108 -1. 
    (ii)  Contracts awarded on either a sole source or competitive basis under the 
PA may be awarded directly to the 8(a) participant; an SBA signature on the contract is not required.  
 2026- O0037  
    (iii)  Notwithstanding the PA, c ontracting officers may award a contract 
following  the procedures at FAR 19.108 and 19.208.</pre>
