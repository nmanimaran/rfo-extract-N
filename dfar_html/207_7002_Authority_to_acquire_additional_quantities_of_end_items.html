    <h1>207.7002 Authority to acquire additional quantities of end items</h1>
    <pre>10 U.S.C. 3069 authorizes DoD to use available funds for the acquisition of an end item 
at a higher quantity than the quantity specified in a law providing the funding for the 
specific end item , if the head of an agency determines that — 
  (a)  The agency has an established requirement for the end item that is expected to 
remain substantially unchanged throughout the period of the acquisition;  
  (b)  It is possible to acquire the higher quantity of the end item without additional 
funding because of production efficiencies or other cost reductions;  
  (c)  The amount of funds used for the acquisition of the higher quantity of the end 
item will not exceed the amount provided under that law for the acquisition of the end item; and  
 
 (d)  The amount provided under that law for the acquisition of the end item is 
sufficient to ensure that each unit of the end item acquired within the higher quantity is fully funded as a complete end item.</pre>
