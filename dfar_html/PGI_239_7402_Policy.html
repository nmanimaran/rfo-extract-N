    <pre>(c)   Foreign carriers .   
   (i)  Frequently, foreign carriers are owned by the government of the country in 
which they operate.  The foreign governments often prescribe the methods of doing 
business.  
   (ii)  In contracts for telecommunications services in foreign countries, describe 
the rates and practices in as much detail as possible.  It is DoD policy not to pay discriminatory rates .  DoD will pay a reasonable rate for telecommunications services or 
the rate charged the military of that country, whichever is less.  
   (iii)  Refer special problems with telecommunications acquisition in foreign 
countries to higher headquarters for resolution with appropriate State Department representatives.  
  (d)  Long- haul telecommunications services .  DISA will acquire all long -haul 
telecommunications services for DoD .  See  DoD Directive 5105.19
, Defense 
Information Systems Agency (DISA).</pre>
