    <pre>(1)  Whenever practicable, provide advance notice of a proposed change order to 
the administrative contracting officer (ACO).  
 2026- O0034 
   (i)  The ACO must  review the proposed change order to ensure compatibility 
with the status of performance.  
 
  (ii)  If the contractor has progressed beyond the effective point specified in the 
proposed change order, the ACO must  determine the earliest practical point at which 
the change order could be made effective and must  advise the contracting officer.  
  (2)  If a change order has been issued and the effective date has been determined 
to be impracticable, the contracting officer must — 
   (i)  Issue another change order to correct, revise, or supersede the first change 
order; then  
   (ii)  Definitize by supplemental agreement citing both change orders.</pre>
