 (b)  Establish an evaluation factor based upon the percentage of the offeror’s total workforce 
that consists of severely disabled individuals employed by the offeror.  Contracting officers may use a rating method in which a higher percentage of the offeror’s total workforce consisting of severely disabled individuals would result in a higher rating for this evaluation factor.</pre>
