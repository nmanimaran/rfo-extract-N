    <h1>PGI 237.802-71 Limitation on service contracts for military flight simulators</h1>
    <pre>When reviewing requirements or participating in acquisition planning that would result in a military department or defense agency acquiring a military flight simulator, the contracting officer will notify the program officials of the prohibition from using a service contract to acquire a military flight simulator at 237.802- 71(b).  
  (1)  If the program officials decide to request a waiver from the Secretary of Defense to 
use a service contract, the contracting officer will  process a request for waiver  by submitting 
the request and appropriate documentation relating to the requirements of DFARS  237.802-
71(b)  to the Office of the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition 
Policy  (Contract Policy) (DPCAP/CP) via email at  
osd.pentagon.ousd-a- s.mbx.asda- dp-c- contractpolicy@mail.mil .  
 
 (2)  The DPCAP/CP action officer will process the request through the Office of the 
Secretary of Defense and will forward the appropriate documentation to the congressional defense committees.  The contracting officer must not award a contract until notified by the 
DPCAP/CP  action officer that the waiver has been approved, the appropriate documentation 
has been transmitted to the congressional defense committees, and the required 30 days have passed.</pre>
