    <h1>232.470 Advance payment pool</h1>
    <pre>(a)  An advance payment pool agreement — 
   (1)  Is a means of financing the performance of more than one contract held by a 
single contractor;  
   (2)  Is especially convenient for the financing of cost -type contracts with 
nonprofit educational or research institutions for experimental or research and development work when several contracts require financing by advance payments.  
When appropriate, pooled advance payments may also be used to finance other types of contracts held by a single contractor; and  
   (3)  May be established — 
    (i)  Without regard to the number of appropriations involved;  
    (ii)  To finance contracts for one or more department(s) or contracting 
activity(ies); or  
    (iii)  In addition to any other advance payment pool agreement at a single 
contractor location when it is more convenient or otherwise preferable to have more than one agreement.</pre>
