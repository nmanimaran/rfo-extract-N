    <h1>PGI 227.7103-18 Acquisition  of other than commercial technical data, computer</h1>
    <pre>software , and computer software documentation and associated rights.   
 
 (a)  Applicable Guidance.   See DoDI 5010.44, Intellectual Property (IP) Acquisition and 
Licensing, sections 4.1 and 4.2, when formulating business advice and contract implementation strategies regarding the program manager’s tailoring of technical data requirements to the needs of the Government.  
  (b)  Compliance with applicable policies.   Work closely with data managers and 
requirements personnel to ensure that technical data, computer software, and computer 
software documentation requirements included in solicitations are consistent with the policy expressed in 227.7103- 1.  
  (c)  Acquisition of technical data.  (1) (i)  Data managers or other requirements personnel 
are responsible for identifying the Government’s life- cycle needs for technical data.   
    (ii)  When establishing t echnical -data needs, requirements personnel must  give 
consideration to—   
     (A)  T he offeror’s economic interests in technical data pertaining to items, 
components, or processes that have been developed at private expense (including the economic interests of small businesses and nontraditional contractors);       (B)  T he Government’s costs to acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, and 
protect the technical data;  
      (C)  R eprocurement needs;  
     (D)  R epair, maintenance, and overhaul philosophies;  
     (E)  S pare and repair part considerations; and  
     (F)  W hether procurement of the items, components, or processes can be 
accomplished on a form, fit, or function basis.   
    (iii)  When the Government will likely obtain unlimited or government purpose 
rights in technical data necessary for competitive spare or repair parts procurements, such 
data should be identified as deliverable technical data items ; and   
    (iv)  The fact that r eprocurement needs m ight not justify  acquir ing detailed 
manufacturing or process data when—   
     (A)  Items or components can be acquired using performance 
specifications, form, fit, and function data ; or  
     (B)  W hen a sufficient number of alternate sources exist that will likely  
provide such items on a performance specification or form, fit, or function basis.  
   (2)  When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for 
data, data managers should, as appropriate,  balance the original assessment of the 
Government’s data needs with data prices contained in the offer.  
 2026- O0036  
 (d)  Acquisition of computer software and computer software documentation.  (1) (i)  
Data managers or other requirements personnel are responsible for identifying the 
Government’s life- cycle needs for computer software and computer software 
documentation.  
    (ii)  To the maximum extent practicable, assessment of life- cycle needs should 
include consider ation of  periodic delivery of computer software and computer software 
documentation including all executable code, source code, associated scripts, build procedures, automation scripts, tools, databases, libraries, test results, data sets, firmware, training mater ials, and any other elements necessary to integrate, test and evaluate, debug, 
deploy, and operate the software application in all relevant environmen ts (e.g., development, 
staging, production).   
    (iii)  See DoDI 5010.44, Intellectual Property (IP) Acquisition and Licensing, 
sections 4.1 and 4.2, when formulating business advice and contract implementation strategies regarding the program manager’s tailoring of software requirements to the needs of the Gov ernment.  
    (iv)  In addition to desired software performance, compatibility, or other technical 
considerations, identification of life- cycle needs should include consider ation of  such factors 
as— 
     (A)  The offeror’s economic interests in software that has been developed at 
private expense (including the economic interests of small businesses and nontraditional contractors);  
     (B)  The Government’s costs to develop, acquire, maintain, store, retrieve, 
and protect the computer software and computer software documentation;  
     (C)  Multiple site or shared use requirements;  
     (D)  Whether the Government’s software maintenance philosophy will 
require the right to modify or have third parties modify the software; and      (E)  Any special computer software documentation requirements.  
   (2) (i) Procurement planning .  The assessment of life- cycle needs should consider 
delivery timelines to facilitate transition to a different contractor or to the Government.  This approach facilitates management of program risk and supports options for flexibility in the transition of s oftware sustainment to another organization.  Ensure that, wherever 
practicable, solicitations and contracts include the requirements for periodic delivery and any delivery timelines for computer software and computer softw are documentation, based upon 
the assessment of life- cycle needs.  To the maximum extent practicable, when assessing 
the life -cycle needs, data managers or other requirements personnel will address in the 
procurement planning and requirements documents (e.g., acquisition plans, purchase requests) the acquisition at appropriate times in the life cycle of all computer software, related recorded information, and associated license rights necessary to—  
     (A) Reproduce, build, or recompile the software from its source code and 
required software libraries (e.g., software libraries called, invoked, or linked by the computer 
 2026- O0036  
 software source code that are necessary for the operation of the software) .  (Based on the 
results of the assessment of life- cycle needs, and to the maximum extent practicable, all 
software capability descriptions should accompany source code (e.g., features, story points, 
use cases) and all as -built architecture and design produc ts, traceability products, interface 
definitions including interfaces to proprietary software elements, and any other requisite documentation.) ; 
     (B) Conduct required computer software testing and evaluation;  
     (C) Integrate and deploy computer programs on relevant hardware 
including developmental, operational, diagnostic, training, or simulation environments; and  
     (D) Sustain and support the software over its life cycle.  
    (ii) Alternatives to delivery of source code and related software design details . 
The assessment of life- cycle needs should consider alternatives to the delivery of source 
code and related software design details for privately developed computer software as necessary to meet the Government’s needs, such as — 
     (A) Technical data and computer software sufficient to implement a modular 
open system approach or a similar approach.  
      (1) In determining whether the Government should require delivery of 
computer software source code and related software design details developed exclusively or partially at private expense, data managers and other requirements personnel are 
responsible for considering whether these alternatives permit the Government to—  
       (i)  Acquire the amount of data needed to procure and support 
systems, material, and services in an economical manner based on a cost or price analysis;  
       (ii)  Meet its management, engineering, and logistics needs; and  
       (iii)  Maintain the currency of acquired technical data or software 
consistent with the assessment of life- cycle needs.  
      (2)  To the extent practicable, the Government should also require open 
interface documentation for any privately developed computer software used in or interoperable with software developed for the Government, to allow for technology insertion on all sides o f the interface, as applicable, and to support the use of modular open system 
approaches ; 
     (B) Access to technical data or computer software, including access 
agreements for cloud- based or subscription- based software products or services .  
      (1)  Access agreements permit the Government to view, print, 
download, annotate, modify, or make derivatives of technical data or computer software stored within a contractor -controlled repository or facility (e.g., in an online environment or in 
person).  Exam ples of access arrangements include remote online authorization to access 
an integrated data environment, product data management system operated by the contractor, or mechanisms authorizing physical entry to a contractor -controlled data 
repository, or cloud -based or subscription- based software products or services.  The 
 2026- O0036  
 negotiated access agreement must  stipulate permissions based on the assessment of life -
cycle needs ; make the access agreement part of the contract.  
 
     (2)  For each technical data or computer software requirement, the 
requiring activity should determine whether the Government’s needs can be better satisfied 
through access or formal delivery of the technical data or software (e.g., physical or electronic transfer of the data into Government custody).  The Government should consider access to tec hnical data or software when—  
       (i)  The delivery of technical data or software is not cost -effective or 
feasible for technical, legal, or contractual reasons; and  
       (ii)  Access meets the Government’s needs for such technical data 
or software throughout the life- cycle of the program ; 
     (C)  Software support and maintenance provided directly from the 
contractor; or  
     (D)  Other contracting or licensing mechanisms including priced options, 
specially negotiated licenses, direct licensing between contractors for qualifying second sources, data escrow agreements, deferred delivery solutions, and subscription agreements .  
      (1)(i)  Under a data escrow agreement, the Government and the 
contractor identify a third- party escrow agent that will keep designated technical data or 
computer software for safekeeping until a contractually specified condition occurs.   
       (ii)  If a contractually specified condition occurs, then the 
Government may obtain delivery of the escrowed technical data or computer software.  
       (iii)  Include the data escrow agreement in the contract.  I nclude in 
the contract the Government’s license rights in the escrowed technical data or computer software.         (2)  Use of data escrow agreements is not preferable in all cases but 
may be useful when formal delivery or access is not feasible or cost -effective during the 
contract’s period of performance or delivery schedule.  
   (3)  When reviewing offers received in response to a solicitation or other request for 
computer software or computer software documentation, data managers should, if appropriate,  balance the original assessment of the Government’s needs with prices offered.  
  (e)  Contract implementation of technical data and software requirements.   Ensure that, 
wherever practicable, solicitations and contracts — 
   (1)  Identify the type and quantity of the technical data to be delivered under the 
contract and the format and media in which the data will be delivered;  
   (2)  Identify the types of computer software and the quantity of computer programs 
and computer software documentation to be delivered, any requirements for multiple users 
 at one site or multiple site licenses, and the format and media in which the software or 
documentation will be delivered;  
   (3 )  Establish each type of data item, computer software, or computer software 
documentation to be delivered as a separate contract line item (this requirement may be satisfied by an exhibit to the contract);  
   (4 )  Identify the prices established for each separately priced deliverable item of 
technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation under a fixed- price 
type contract;  
   (5)  Include delivery schedules and acceptance criteria for each deliverable item  of 
technical data or computer software;    (6 )  Specifically identify the place of delivery for each deliverable item  of technical 
data or computer software; and    (7 )  Specify in the negotiated terms that any required other than commercial 
computer software, related recorded information, and associated license rights identified in the assessment of life- cycle needs in paragraph (b) of this section must , to the extent 
appropriate—     (i)  Include computer software delivered in a digital format compatible with 
applicable computer programs on relevant system hardware;  
    (ii)  Not rely on additional internal or external other than commercial or 
commercial technical data and software, unless such technical data or software is — 
     (A)  Included in the items to be delivered with license rights sufficient to 
meet the Government’s needs; or  
     (B)  Commercially available with license rights sufficient to meet the 
Government’s needs; and  
    (iii)  Include sufficient information, with license rights sufficient to meet the 
Government’s needs, to support maintenance and understanding of interfaces and software version history when the negotiated terms do not allow for the inclusion of the external or additional other than commercial or commercial technical data and software.</pre>
