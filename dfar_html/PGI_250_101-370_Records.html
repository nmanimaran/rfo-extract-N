    <h1>PGI 250.101-370 Records</h1>
    <pre>(a) Departments and agencies must — 
 
  (1) Prepare a preliminary record when a request for a contract adjustment under 
FAR 50.103 is filed (see DFARS  250.103- 5(1)). 
 
  (2) Prepare a final record stating the disposition of the request (see 
PGI 250.103- 6). 
 
  (3) Designate the offices or officials responsible for preparing, submitting, and 
receiving all records required by DFARS Subpart 250.1. Records must  be maintained 
by the contract adjustment boards of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, respectively, and by the headquarters of the defense agencies.  
 
 (b) A suggested format for the record is the Record of Request for Adjustment 
shown at the end of this section.  This format permits the information required for the 
preliminary and final records to be combined on one form.  
 
The following instructions are provided for those items in the format that are not self -
explanatory:  
 
  (1) Extent  of performance as of date of request .  State the degree of completion 
of the contract;  e.g., 50 percent completed or performance not yet begun.  If work is 
completed, state the date of completion and whether final payment has been made.  
 (2) Award  procedure.   State whether the contract was awarded under sealed 
bidding or negotiated procedures .  Cite the specific authority for using other than full 
and open competition, if applicable, e.g., 10 U.S.C. 3204(a).  
 (3) Type of contract .  State the type of contract (see FAR Part 16); e.g., FFP 
(firm-fixed -price).  
 (4) Category  of case .  State whether the request involves a modification without 
consideration, a mistake, or an informal commitment .  If the case involves more than 
one category, identify both; list the most significant category first.  
 (5) Amount  or description of request .  If the request is expressed in dollars, state 
the amount and whether it is an increase or decrease.  If the request cannot be expressed in monetary terms, provide a brief description ; e.g., &quot;Cancellation&quot; or 
&quot;Modification.&quot; Even if the adjustment is not easily expressed in terms of dollars, if the contractor has made an estimate in the request, that estimate should be stated.  
 
  (6) Action  below  Secretarial  level.  State the disposition of the case, the office 
that took the action and the date the action was taken.  The disposition should be stated 
 50 
 as &quot;Withdrawn,&quot; &quot;Denied,&quot; &quot;Approved,&quot; or &quot;Forwarded.&quot; If the request was approved, in 
whole or in part, state the dollar amount or nature of the action (as explained in paragraph (2)(v) of this section) .  The date should correspond with the date of the 
memorandum of decision or of the letter forwarding the request to the contract adjustment board or other deciding body.  
 (7) Action  by contract  adjustment  board and date.   State the disposition and date 
of disposition of the case by the contract adjustment board.  Provide the same 
information as for paragraph (2)(vi) of this section.  
 (8) Implementation and date.   State the appropriate action; e.g., &quot;Modification,&quot; 
&quot;New Contract,&quot; or &quot;Letter of Denial.&quot;
