   When the final price of an unpriced change order is negotiated after completion 
of a substantial portion of the required performance, the head of the contracting 
activity must  ensure the profit allowed reflects — 
 
 (a)  Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred during contract 
performance before negotiation of the final price;  
  (b)  Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs expected to be incurred 
during performance of the remainder of the contract; and   (c)  The extent to which costs have been incurred prior to definitization of the 
unpriced change order ( see 215.404).  The risk assessment must  be documented in 
the price negotiation memorandum.  
 243.370–7   Plans and reports.  
 To provide for enhanced management and oversight of unpriced change orders, departments and agencies must — 
  (a)  Include in the Consolidated Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA) 
Management Plan required by  217.7405
, the actions planned and taken to ensure 
that unpriced change orders are definitized in accordance with this subsection; and 
  (b)  Include in the Consolidated UCA Management Report required by  217.7405
, 
each unpriced change order with an estimated value exceeding $5 million.</pre>
