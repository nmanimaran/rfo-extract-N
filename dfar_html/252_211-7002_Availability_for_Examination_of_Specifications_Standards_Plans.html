   “Concatenated unique item identifier” means — 
     (1)  For items that are serialized within the enterprise identifier,  the linking 
together of the unique identifier data elements in order of the  issuing agency code, 
enterprise identifier, and unique serial number within the enter prise identifier; or  
    (2)  For items that are serialized within the original part, lot, or batch
