    (i)  Allowing the contractor additional time to correct the deficiency and 
submit a corrected proposal;  
    (ii)  Considering another type of contract, e.g., a fixed -price incentive (firm 
target) contract instead of firm- fixed -price;  
    (iii)  Using additional cost analysis techniques to determine the 
reasonableness of the cost elements affected by the deficiency;  
    (iv)  Segregating the questionable areas as a cost -reimbursable line item;

of negotiation;  
    (ii)  Specify a deadline or  event by which the contractor must  submit a
