    <h1>236.202-371 Statutory Fee Limitation</h1>
    <pre>(a )  The statutes at 10 U.S.C. 7540, 8612, and 9540, for the Departments of the 
Army, Navy, and Air Force, respectively, limit the contract price (or fee) for architect- engineer services for the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and 
specifications to 10 percent of the project&#x27;s estimated construction cost.  (See PGI 
236.202- 371).  
  (b )  The 10 percent limit also applies to contract modifications, including 
modifications involving — 
   (1 )  Work not initially included in the contract; apply the 10 percent limit to the 
revised total estimated construction cost; and  
   (2 )  Redesign work; apply the 10 percent limit by — 
    (i )  Adding the estimated construction cost of the redesign features to he 
original estimated construction cost;  
    ( ii)  Adding the contract cost for the original design to the contract cost for 
redesign; and  
 36 
    ( iii)  Dividing the total contract design cost by the total estimated 
construction cost.  The resulting percentage may not exceed the 10 percent statutory 
limitation.  
 
 (c )  The 10 percent limit applies only to that portion of the contract (or modification) 
price attributable to the preparation of designs, plans, drawings, and specifications.  If a 
contract or modification also includes other services, the part of the price attributable to the other services is not subject to the 10 percent limit.
