    <pre>(i)(A)  When contracting for information technology, whether as a service or as a supply, that 
is a covered system or covered item of supply, consider the need for a consent to 
subcontract requirement regarding supply chain risk (see subpart 239.73).  In collaboration with the requiring activity , assess the criticality of the component or system to be supplied 
and potential supply chain risk concerns . 
 (B)  The contracting officer’s  written consent to subcontract is necessary when 
subcontractors are selected or modified during contract performance.   
 (C)  If  a potential subcontractor ’s risk is beyond the tolerance of the system and mission, the 
requiring activity must inform the contracting officer . The contracting officer can use the 
authority granted in section 806 of Pub. L. 111- 383 to withhold consent for the contractor to 
subcontract with a particular source or exclude a source from consideration as specified in DFARS 239.73.</pre>
