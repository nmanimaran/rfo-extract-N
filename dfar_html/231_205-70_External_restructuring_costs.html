    <h1>231.205-70 External restructuring costs</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Scope.  This subsection  contains policies  and procedures for allowing contractor 
external restructuring costs when savings would result for DoD and implements  10 
U.S.C. 3761.  
  (b)  Definitions.  As used in this section -- 
    “Business combination” means a transaction whereby assets or operations of 
two or more companies not previously under common ownership or control are combined, whether by merger, acquisition, or sale/purchase of assets.  
    “External restructuring activities” means restructuring activities occurring 
after a business combination,  affect ing the operations of companies not previously 
under common ownership or control.  They exclude  restructuring within a single 
company or only affecting one company from the combination.  External restructuring 
activities are a direct outgrowth of a business combination  and normally occur within 3 
years of the business combination.  
    “Restructuring activities” means nonroutine, nonrecurring, or extraordinary 
activities to combine facilities, operations, or workforce, to eliminate redundant capabilities, improve future operations, and reduce overall costs.  Restructuring activities exclude  routine or ongoing repositionings and redeployments of a contractor’s 
productive facilities or workforce (e.g., normal plant rearrangement or employee relocation), and exclude  other routine or ordinary activities charged as indirect costs 
that would  otherwise have been incurred (e.g., planning and analysis, contract 
administration and oversight, or recurring financial and administrative support).  
    “Restructuring costs”  means both direct and indirect  costs  of restructuring 
activities.  Allowable r estructuring costs include, but are not limited  to, severance pay 
for employees, early retirement incentive payments for employees, employee retraining costs, relocation expense for retained employees, and relocation and rearrangement of plant and equipment.  For purposes of this definition, restructur ing costs under $2.5 
million related to  external restructuring activities allocated to DoD contracts are not 
subject to the audit, review, and determination requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this subsection; instead, standard  cost allowability rules in FAR Part 31 apply.  
    “Restructuring savings” means both direct and indirect cost reductions 
result ing from restructuring activities.  Cost reassignments  to future periods are not 
restructuring savings.

 (c)  Limitations on cost allowability.  Restructuring costs associated with external 
restructuring activities are not  allowed unless — 
   (1)  The  costs are allowable in accordance with FAR Part 31 and DFARS Part 
231; 
   (2)  An audit of projected restructuring costs and restructuring savings is 
performed;  
   (3)  The administrative contracting officer (ACO) reviews the audit report , 
projected costs , and projected savings, then negotiates an advance agreement per  
paragraph (d) of this subsection; and  
   (4)(i)  The  official designated in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this subsection makes a 
written determination  that the audited projected savings, on a present value basis, for 
DoD resulting from the restructuring will exceed either  
     (A)  The costs allowed by a factor of at least two to one; or  
     (B)  The costs allowed, and the business combination will result in the 
preservation of a critical capability that DoD might otherwise lose.  
    (ii)(A)  If the amount of restructuring costs is expected to exceed $25 million 
over a 5 -year period, the designated official is the Under Secretary of Defense 
(Acquisition and Sustainment) or the Principal Deputy.  This authority cannot  be 
delegated below the Assistant Secretary of Defense level. 
     (B)  For all other cases, on a nondelegable basis, the designated official 
is the Director of the Defense Contract Management Agency.   
  (d)  Procedures and ACO responsibilities.  As soon as it is known that the contractor 
will incur restructuring costs for external restructuring activities, the ACO shall follow the procedures at PGI 231.205- 70(d). 
  (e)  Information needed to obtain a determination.  
   (1)  The novation agreement (if one is required).  
   (2)  The contractor’s restructuring proposal.  
   (3)  The proposed advance agreement.  
   (4)  The audit report.  
   (5)  Any other pertinent information.  
   (6)  The ACO’s recommendation for a determination.  This recommendation 
must clearly indicate one of the following, consistent with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this subsection:  
    (i)  The audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed by a 
factor of at least two to one on a present value basis.

   (ii)  The business combination will result in the preservation of a critical 
capability that might otherwise be lost to DoD, and the audited projected savings for DoD will exceed the costs allowed on a present value basis.  
  (f)  Contracting officer responsibilities.  
   (1)  The contracting officer, with the ACO ’s input , should consider a repricing 
clause in noncompetitive fixed -price contracts negotiated during the period between  
    (i)  The time a business combination is announced; and  
    (ii)  The time the contractor’s forward pricing rates are adjusted to reflect 
the impact of restructuring.  
   (2)  U se of a repricing clause depends on the specific situation , including  
    (i)  When the restructuring will take place;  
    (ii)  When restructuring savings will begin to be realized;  
    (iii)  The contract performance period;  
    (iv)  Whether the contracting parties can  reasonabl y estimate the 
restructuring impact on the contract; and  
    (v)  The size of the potential dollar impact of restructuring on the contract.  
   (3)  If the contracting officer decides to use a repricing clause, the clause must 
provide for a downward- only price adjustment to ensure that DoD receives its 
appropriate share of restructuring net savings.</pre>
