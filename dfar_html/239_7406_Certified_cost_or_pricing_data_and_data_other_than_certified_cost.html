    <h1>239.7406 Certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost</h1>
    <pre>or pricing data.  
  (a)  Common carriers are not required to submit certified cost or pricing data 
before award of contracts for tariffed services .  Rates or preliminary estimates 
quoted by a common carrier for tariffed telecommunications services are considered to be prices set by regulation within the provisions of 10 U.S.C .  3703.  This is true 
even if the tariff is set after execution of the contract .   
  (b)  Rates or preliminary estimates quoted by a common carrier for nontariffed 
telecommunications services or by a noncommon carrier for any telecommunications service are not considered prices set by law or regulation.  
  (c)  Contracting officers must  obtain sufficient data to determine that the prices 
are reasonable in accordance with FAR 15.403- 3 or 15.403- 4.  See  PGI 239.7406 for 
examples of instances where additional data may be necessary to determine price reasonableness.</pre>
