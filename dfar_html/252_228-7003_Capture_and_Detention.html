    <h1>252.228-7003 Capture and Detention</h1>
    <pre>As prescribed in 228.371(c), use the following clause:  
 
CAPTURE AND DETENTION (DEC 1991)  
  (a)  As used in this clause — 
 28 
   (1)  “Captured person” means any employee of the Contractor who is — 
 
   (i)  Assigned to duty outside the United States for the performance of this 
contract; and     (ii)  Found to be missing from his or her place of employment under 
circumstances that make it appear probable that the absence is due to the action of the force of any power not allied with the United States in a common military effort; or  
    (iii)  Known to have been taken prisoner, hostage, or otherwise detained by 
the force of such power, whether or not actually engaged in employment at the time of capture; provided, that at the time of capture or detention, the person was either—      (A)  Engaged in activity directly arising out of and in the course of 
employment under this contract; or  
     (B)  Captured in an area where required to be only in order to perform 
this contract.  
   (2)  A “period of detention” begins with the day of capture and continues until 
the captured person is returned to the place of employment, the United States, or is able to be returned to the jurisdiction of the United States, or until the person&#x27;s death  is 
established or legally presumed to have occurred by evidence satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, whichever occurs first.  
   (3)  “United States” comprises geographically the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia.  
   (4)  “War Hazards Compensation Act” refers to the statute compiled in Chapter 
12 of Title 42, U.S. Code (sections 1701 -1717), as amended.  
  (b)  If pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to capture, the Contractor is 
obligated to pay and has paid detention benefits to a captured person, or the person&#x27;s dependents, the Government will reimburse the Contractor up to an amount equal to the lesser of — 
   (1)  Total wage or salary being paid at the time of capture due from the 
Contractor to the captured person for the period of detention; or  
   (2)  That amount which would have been payable if the detention had occurred 
under circumstances covered by the War Hazards Compensation Act.  
  (c)  The period of detention shall not be considered as time spent in contract 
performance, and the Government shall not be obligated to make payment for that time except as provided in this clause.  
  (d)  The obligation of the Government shall apply to the entire period of detention, 
except that it is subject to the availability of funds from which payment can be made.  The rights and obligations of the parties under this clause shall survive prior ex piration, 
completion, or termination of this contract.  
 28 
  (e) The Contractor shall not be reimbursed under this clause for payments made if 
the employees were entitled to compensation for capture and detention under the War 
Hazards Compensation Act, as amended.
