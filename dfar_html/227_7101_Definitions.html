    <pre>As used in this subpart — 
 “Commercial computer software ” means software developed or regularly used for 
nongovernmental purposes which—  
  (1)  Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;  
  (2)  Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;  
  (3)  Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public but will be available 
for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or   (4)  Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this definition and 
would require only minor modification to meet the requirements of this contract.  
 “Computer program ” means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form 
that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.  
 “Computer software ” means computer programs, source code, source code listings, 
object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, recreated, or recompiled.  Computer software does not include computer data bases or computer 
software documentation.  
 “Computer software documentation ” means owner’s manuals, user’s manuals, 
installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of

instructions for using the software.  
 “Contractor”  means a contractor to include a contractor’s subcontractors, suppliers, or 
potential subcontractors or suppliers at any tier.  
 “Covered Government support contractor”  means a contractor (other than a litigation 
support contractor covered by 252.204 -7014) under a contract, the primary purpose of 
which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government’s management and oversight of a program or effort, rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort, provided that the contractor—  
  (1)  Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first -tier subcontractor on the 
program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or 
produced on the program or eff ort; and 
  (2)  Receives access to technical data or computer software for performance of a 
Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227 -7994, Limitations on the Use 
or Disclosure of Government -Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.  
 “Detailed manufacturing or process data ” means technical data that describe the steps, 
sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.  
 “Developed ” means —  
  (1)  (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.)  An 
item, component, or process exists and is workable.  Thus, the item or component must 
have been constructed or the process practiced.  Workability is generally established 
when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended.  Whether, how much, and what type of 
analysi s or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the 
item, component, or process, and the state of the art.  To be considered “developed,” the 
item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title  35 of the United States Code;  
  (2)  A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to 
the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;  
  (3)  Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed 
to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose; or  
  (4)  Computer software documentation the contractor must deliver under a contract 
has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements 
under that contract.
