    <h1>PGI 240.370-8 Cyber incident and compromise reporting</h1>
    <pre>(a)  When a cyber incident is reported by a contractor, the DoD Cyber Crime Center 
(DC3) will send an unclassified encrypted email containing the cyber incident report to the contracting officer(s) identified on the Incident Collection Format (ICF) .  The DC3 
may request the contracting officer send a digitally signed e- mail to DC3.  
   (1)  The procuring contracting officer (PCO) shall notify the requiring activities that 
have contracts identified in the ICF .  In cases where an administrative contracting officer 
(ACO) receives the cyber incident report, in lieu of the PCO, the ACO shall notify the PCO for each affected contract, who will then notify the requiring activity.  
   (2)  In cases of cyber incidents involving multiple contracts, the DoD  
components will collaboratively designate a single contracting officer to coordinate additional actions required of the contractor, on behalf of the affected DoD components.  
The requiring activity will notify the contracting officer once a lead is designated.  
   (3)  If the requiring activity requests an assessment of compliance with the 
requirements of the clause at DFARS 252.204- 7012 related to the cyber incident, the 
contracting officer shall — 
    (i)  Consult with the DoD component Chief Information Officer (CIO)/cyber 
security office;  
 2026- O0025 
    (ii)  Request a description of the contractor’s implementation of the security  
requirements in NIST SP 800- 171, “Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in 
Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations” (see 
http://dx.doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800 -171) in order to support evaluation of whether any of 
the controls were inadequate, or if any of the controls were not implemented at the time of the incident; and  
    (iii)  Provide a copy of the assessment of contractor compliance to the requiring 
activity, the DoD CIO at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil, and the other contracting officers listed in the 
cyber incident report.  
  (b)  When requested by the contractor, the contracting officer shall provide the contractor 
with the “Instructions for Malware Submission” document available at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/docs/Instructions_for_Malware_Submission.docx .  The 
contracting officer should never receive malicious software directly from the contractor.  
  (c)  If the requiring activity requests access to contractor information or equipment, in 
accordance with DFARS 252.204- 7012(f), the contracting officer shall provide a written 
request to the contractor.  
  (d)  For additional information on cyber incident reporting, see the Frequently Asked 
Questions document at http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/network_penetration_reporting_and_contracting.html.</pre>
