    <h1>252.204-7012 Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber</h1>
    <pre>Incident Reporting.  
As prescribed in 240.370- 5(c), use the following clause:  
 
SAFEGUARDING COVERED DEFENSE INFORMATION AND CYBER 
INCIDENT REPORTING ( MAY 2024)  
 
 (a)  Definitions .  As used in this clause — 
 
 Adequate security  means protective measures that are commensurate with the 
consequences and probability of loss, misuse, or unauthorized access to, or 
modification of information.  
  Compromise means disclosure of information to unauthorized persons, or a 
violation of the security policy of a system, in which unauthorized intentional or unintentional disclosure, modification, destruction, or loss of an object, or the copying of information to un authorized media may have occurred.  
  Contractor attributional/proprietary information  means information that 
identifies the contractor(s), whether directly or indirectly, by the grouping of information that can be traced back to the contractor(s) ( e.g., program description, 
facility locations), personally identifiable information, as well as trade secrets, 
commercial or financial information, or other commercially sensitive information that is not customarily shared outside of the company.  
  Controlled technical information  means technical information with military or 
space application that is subject to controls on the access, use, reproduction, modification, performance, display, release, disclosure, or dissemination .  Controlled 
technical information would meet the criteria, if disseminated, for distribution statements B through F using the criteria set forth in DoD Instruction 5230.24, Distribution Statements on Technical Documents .  The term does not include 
information that is lawfully p ublicly available without restrictions.  
  Covered contractor information system means an unclassified information 
system that is owned, or operated by or for, a contractor and that processes, stores, or transmits covered defense information.  
  Covered defense information  means unclassified controlled technical information 
or other information, as described in the Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) Registry at http://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category -list.html , that requires 
safeguarding or dissemination controls pursuant to and consistent with law, regulations, and Governmentwide policies, and is — 
   (1)  Marked or otherwise identified in the contract, task order, or delivery 
order and provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in support of the performance of the contract; or  
 2026- O0025 
 40 
   (2)  Collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on 
behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract.  
 
 Cyber incident  means actions taken through the use of computer networks that 
result in a compromise or an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing therein.  
  Forensic analysis  means the practice of gathering, retaining, and analyzing 
computer- related data for investigative purposes in a manner that maintains the 
integrity of the data.  
  Information system means a discrete set of information resources organized for 
the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.  
  Malicious software  means computer software or firmware intended to perform 
an unauthorized process that will have adverse impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system .  This definition includes a virus, 
worm, Trojan horse, or other code -based entity that infects a host, as well as 
spyware and some forms of adware.  
  Media means physical devices or writing surfaces including, but is not limited to, 
magnetic tapes, optical disks, magnetic disks, large- scale integration memory chips, 
and printouts onto which covered defense information is recorded, stored, or printed within a covered contractor information system.  
  Operationally critical support  means supplies or services designated by the 
Government as critical for airlift, sealift, intermodal transportation services, or logistical support that is essential to the mobilization, deployment, or sustainment of the Armed Forces in a contingency oper ation.  
  Rapidly report  means within 72 hours of discovery of any cyber incident.  
  Technical information  means technical data or computer software, as those 
terms are defined in the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7013,  Rights in Technical Data—
Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, regardless of whether or not the clause is incorporated in this solicitation or contract. Examples of technical information include research and engineering data, engineering  drawings, 
and associated lists, specifications, standards, process sheets, manuals, technical reports, technical orders, catalog -item identification s, data sets, studies and 
analyses and related information, and computer software executable code and source code.  
  (b)  Adequate security .  The Contractor shall provide adequate security on all 
covered contractor information systems .  To provide adequate security, the 
Contractor shall implement, at a minimum, the following information security protections:  
 2026- O0025 
 40 
   (1)  For covered contractor information systems that are part of an 
information technology (IT) service or system operated on behalf of the Government, 
the following security requirements apply:  
    (i)  Cloud computing services shall be subject to the security 
requirements specified in the clause 252.239- 7010, Cloud Computing Services, of 
this contract.  
    (ii)  Any other such IT service or system ( i.e., other than cloud 
computing) shall be subject to the security requirements specified elsewhere in this contract.  
  (2)  For covered contractor information systems that are not part of an IT service 
or system operated on behalf of the Government and therefore are not subject to the security requirement specified at paragraph (b)(1) of this clause, the following security requ irements apply:  
    (i)  Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this clause, the covered 
contractor information system shall be subject to the security requirements in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, “Protecting Contro lled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information 
Systems and Organizations” (available via the internet at https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800 ) in effect at the time the solicitation is 
issued or as authorized by the Contracting Officer.  
 
   (ii)(A)  The Contractor shall implement NIST SP 800 -171, as soon as 
practical, but not later than December 31, 2017.  For all contracts awarded prior to October 1, 2017, the Contractor shall notify the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO), via email at osd.dibcsia@mail.mil , within 30 days of contract award, of any 
security requirements specified by NIST SP 800 -171 not implemented at the time of 
contract award.  
     (B)  The Contractor shall submit requests to vary from NIST SP 800 -
171 in writing to the Contracting Officer, for consideration by the DoD CIO .  The 
Contractor need not implement any security requirement adjudicated by an authorized representative of the DoD CIO to be nonapplicable or to have an alternative, but equally effective, security measure that may be implemented in its place.  
     (C)  If the DoD CIO has previously adjudicated the contractor&#x27;s 
requests indicating that a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally effective, a copy of that approval shall be provided to the Contracting Officer when req uesting its recognition under this contract.  
     (D)  If the Contractor intends to use an external cloud service 
provider to store, process, or transmit any covered defense information in performance of this contract, the Contractor shall require and ensure that the cloud service provider meets security requi rements equivalent to those established by the 
Government for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) Moderate baseline ( https://www.fedramp.gov/documents- templates/ ) 
 2026- O0025 
 40 
 and that the cloud service provider complies with requirements in paragraphs (c) 
through (g) of this clause for cyber incident reporting, malicious software, media preservation and protection, access to additional information and equipment necessary for fo rensic analysis, and cyber incident damage assessment.  
   (3)  Apply other information systems security measures when the Contractor 
reasonably determines that information systems security measures, in addition to those identified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this clause, may be required to provide adequate securit y in a dynamic environment or to accommodate special 
circumstances ( e.g., medical devices) and any individual, isolated, or temporary 
deficiencies based on an assessed risk or vulnerability. These measures may be addressed in a system security plan.  
  (c)  Cyber incident reporting requirement.  
   (1)  When the Contractor discovers a cyber incident that affects a covered 
contractor information system or the covered defense information residing therein, or that affects the contractor&#x27;s ability to perform the requirements of the contract that are designate d as operationally critical support and identified in the contract, 
the Contractor shall — 
    (i)  Conduct a review for evidence of compromise of covered defense 
information, including, but not limited to, identifying compromised computers, servers, specific data, and user accounts .  This review shall also include analyzing 
covered contractor information system(s) that were part of the cyber incident, as 
well as other information systems on the Contractor&#x27;s network(s), that may have been accessed as a result of the incident in order to identify compromised covered 
defense information, or that aff ect the Contractor&#x27;s ability to provide operationally 
critical support; and     (ii)  Rapidly report cyber incidents to DoD at https://dibnet.dod.mil . 
   (2)  Cyber incident report .  The cyber incident report shall be treated as 
information created by or for DoD and shall include, at a minimum, the required elements at https://dibnet.dod.mil . 
   (3)  Medium assurance certificate requirement .  In order to report cyber 
incidents in accordance with this clause, the Contractor or subcontractor shall have or acquire a DoD -approved medium assurance certificate to report cyber incidents. 
For information on obtaining a DoD -approved medium assurance certificate, see 
https://public.cyber.mil/eca/ . 
  (d)  Malicious software.   When the Contractor or subcontractors discover and 
isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident, submit the malicious software to DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) in accordance with instructions provided by DC3 or the Contracting Off icer.  Do not send the malicious 
software to the Contracting Officer.  
  (e)  Media preservation and protection .  When a Contractor discovers a cyber 
incident has occurred, the Contractor shall preserve and protect images of all 
 2026- O0025 
 40 
 known affected information systems identified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause 
and all relevant monitoring/packet capture data for at least 90 days from the submission of the cyber incident report to allow DoD to request the media or decline interest.  
  (f)  Access to additional information or equipment necessary for forensic analysis .  
Upon request by DoD, the Contractor shall provide DoD with access to additional information or equipment that is necessary to conduct a forensic analysis.  
  (g)  Cyber incident damage assessment activities.   If DoD elects to conduct a 
damage assessment, the Contracting Officer will request that the Contractor provide all of the damage assessment information gathered in accordance with paragraph (e) of this clause.  
  (h)  DoD safeguarding and use of contractor attributional/proprietary 
information .  The Government shall protect against the unauthorized use or release 
of information obtained from the contractor (or derived from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that includes contractor 
attributional/proprietary information, including such information submitted in accordance with paragraph (c) .  To the maximum extent practicable, the Contractor 
shall identify and mark attributional/proprietary information .  In making an 
authorized release of such information, the Government will implement appropriate procedures to minimize the contractor attributional/proprietary information that is included in such authorized release, seeking to include only that information that is necessary for the authorized purpose(s) for which the information is being released.  
  (i)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information not 
created by or for DoD .  Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived 
from information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is not created by or for DoD is authorized to be released outside of DoD — 
   (1)  To entities with missions that may be affected by such information;  
   (2)  To entities that may be called upon to assist in the diagnosis, detection, 
or mitigation of cyber incidents;  
   (3)  To Government entities that conduct counterintelligence or law 
enforcement investigations;  
   (4)  For national security purposes, including cyber situational awareness 
and defense purposes (including with Defense Industrial Base (DIB) participants in the program at 32 CFR part 236); or  
   (5)  To a support services contractor (“recipient”) that is directly supporting 
Government activities under a contract that includes the clause at 252.204- 7009, 
Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Third -Party Contractor Reported Cyber 
Incident Information.  
  (j)  Use and release of contractor attributional/proprietary information created by 
or for DoD .  Information that is obtained from the contractor (or derived from 
 2026- O0025 
 40 
 information obtained from the contractor) under this clause that is created by or for 
DoD (including the information submitted pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause) is authorized to be used and released outside of DoD for purposes and activities author ized by paragraph (i) of this clause, and for any other lawful Government 
purpose or activity, subject to all applicable statutory, regulatory, and policy based restrictions on the Government&#x27;s use and release of such information.  
  (k)  The Contractor shall conduct activities under this clause in accordance with 
applicable laws and regulations on the interception, monitoring, access, use, and disclosure of electronic communications and data.  
  (l)  Other safeguarding or reporting requirements.   The safeguarding and cyber 
incident reporting required by this clause in no way abrogates the Contractor&#x27;s responsibility for other safeguarding or cyber incident reporting pertaining to its unclassified information systems as required by other applicable clauses of this contract, or as a result of other applicable U.S. Government statutory or regulatory requirements.  
  (m)  Subcontracts.   The Contractor shall — 
   (1)  Include this clause, including this paragraph (m) , in subcontracts, or 
similar contractual instruments, for operationally critical support, or for which subcontract performance will involve covered defense information, including subcontracts for commercial products or commercial services, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall determine if the information 
required for subcontractor performance retains its identity as covered defense information and will require protection under this clause, and, if necessary, consult with  the Contracting Officer; and 
   (2)  Require subcontractors to — 
    (i)  Notify the prime Contractor (or next higher -tier subcontractor) when 
submitting a request to vary from a NIST SP 800- 171 security requirement to the 
Contracting Officer, in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this clause; and  
    (ii)  Provide the incident report number, automatically assigned by DoD, 
to the prime Contractor (or next higher- tier subcontractor) as soon as practicable, 
when reporting a cyber incident to DoD as required in paragraph (c) of this clause.
