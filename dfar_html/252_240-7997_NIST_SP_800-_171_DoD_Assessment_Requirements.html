     (ii)  A thorough document review;  
 
    (iii)  Verification, examination, and demonstration of a Contractor&#x27;s 
system security plan to validate that NIST SP 800 -171 security requirements have 
been implemented as described in the contractor&#x27;s system security plan; and      (iv)  Discussions with the contractor to obtain additional information 
or clarification, as needed; and  
   (2)  Results in a confidence level of “High” in the resulting score.

  (b)  Applicability.   This clause applies to covered contractor information systems 
that are required to comply with the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800 -171, in accordance with Defense 
Federal Acquisition Regulation System (DFA RS) clause at 252.204- 7012, 
Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, of this contract.  
  (c)  Requirements.   The Contractor shall provide access to its facilities, systems, 
and personnel necessary for the Government to conduct a Medium or High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment, using the methodology described at 32 CFR 170.24,  if 
necessary.   The results of Medium or High NIST SP 800 -171 DoD Assessment s, 
when conducted by DCMA , will take precedence over any other assessment , in 
accordance with 32 CFR 170.16(a)(1)(iv), 32 CFR 170.17(a)(1)(iv), and 32 CFR 170.18(a)(1)(iv) .   
  (d)  Procedures.   Summary level scores for all assessments will be posted in the 
Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) ( https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/ ) to 
provide DoD Components visibility into the summary level scores of strategic assessments.  
   Medium and High Assessments.   DoD will post the following Medium and/or 
High Assessment summary level scores to SPRS for each system security plan assessed:  
    (i)  The standard assessed ( e.g., NIST SP 800 -171 Rev 1).  
    (ii)  Organization conducting the assessment, i .e., DCMA.  
    (iii)  All industry CAGE code(s) associated with the information 
system(s) addressed by the system security plan.  
    (iv)  Date and level of the assessment, i.e., medium or high.  
    (v)  Summary level score ( overall numerical score, not the individual 
value assigned for each requirement).  
    (vi)  Date that all requirements are expected to be implemented based on 
information gathered from associated plan(s) of action developed in accordance with NIST SP 800 -171. 
  (e)  Rebuttals.   (1) DoD will provide Medium and High Assessment summary 
level scores to the Contractor and offer the opportunity for rebuttal and adjudication of assessment summary level scores prior to posting the summary level scores to SPRS (see SPRS User&#x27;s Guide https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/SPRS_Awardee.pdf ). 
   (2)  Upon completion of each assessment, the contractor has 14 business 
days to provide additional information to demonstrate that they meet any security requirements not observed by the assessment team or to rebut the findings that may be of question.

 (f)  Accessibility.   (1) Assessment summary level scores posted in SPRS are 
available to DoD personnel, and are protected, in accordance with the standards set forth in DoD Instruction 5000.79, Defense -wide Sharing and Use of Supplier and 
Product Performance Information (PI).  
   (2)  Authorized representatives of the Contractor for which the assessment 
was conducted may access SPRS to view their own summary level scores, in accordance with the SPRS Software User&#x27;s Guide for Awardees/Contractors available at https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/SPRS_Awardee.pdf . 
   (3)  A High NIST SP 800 -171 DoD Assessment may result in documentation 
in addition to that listed in this clause .  DoD will retain and protect any such 
documentation as “Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)” and intended for internal DoD use only.   The information will be protected against unauthorized use 
and release, including through the exercise of applicable exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act ( e.g., Exemption 4 covers trade secrets and commercial 
or financial information obtained fr om a contractor that is privileged or 
confidential).  
  (g)  Subcontracts.   The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, 
including this paragraph (g) , in all subcontracts and other contractual instruments,
