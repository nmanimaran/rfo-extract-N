    <h1>PGI 236.101-6 Government cost estimate</h1>
    <pre>(1)  Designate the Government estimate as “CUI” (see https://www.dodcui.mil/ ) unless 
the information is classified.  If it is, handle the estimate in accordance with security regulations.  
  (2)  For sealed bid acquisitions — 
   (i)  File a sealed copy of the Government estimate with the bids.  (In the case of two-
step acquisitions, this is done in the second step.)  
   (ii)  After the bids are read and recorded, remove the “CUI”  marking (see 
https://www.dodcui.mil/ ) and read and record the estimate as if it were a bid, in the same 
detail as the bids.</pre>
