any statewide regulatory body, or any body  with less than statewide jurisdiction 
when operating under the state authority .  Regulatory bodies whose decisions are 
not subject to judicial appeal and regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by the same entity that creates the regulatory body are not governmental regulatory bodies.  
 (b)  The Contractor shall acknowledge a communication service authorization or 
other type order for supplies and facilities by — 
  (1)  Commencing performance after receipt of an order; or  
   (2)  Written acceptance by a duly authorized representative.  
  (c)  The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this 
agreement/contract in accordance with all applicable tariffs, rates, charges, regulations, requirements, terms, and conditions of —

  (2)  Service as lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body.  
 (d) The Government will not prepay for services.  
 
 (e)  For nontariffed services, the Contractor shall charge the Government at the 
lowest rate and under the most favorable terms and conditions for similar service 
and facilities offered to any other customer.  
  (f)  Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each case, start with the 
satisfactory beginning of service or provision of facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.  
  (g)  Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier than normal .  
Examples are overtime pay or special shipment .  When authorized, expediting 
charges shall be the additional costs incurred by the Contractor and the subcontractor .  The Government shall pay expediting charges only when — 
   (1)  They are provided for in the tariff established by a governmental 
regulatory body; or  
   (2)  They are authorized in a communication service authorization or other 
contractual document.  
  (h)  When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and the 
development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is required, the Government may — 
   (1)  Provide the equipment; or  
 
  (2)  Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities .  If the 
Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.  
  (i)  If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the 
services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted under applicable tariffs file d by the Contractor with the regulatory commission in effect at 
the time of deferral or change .  If no tariffs are in effect, the Government and the 
Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement .  Failure to agree 
on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.
