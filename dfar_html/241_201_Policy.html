    <h1>241.201 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(1)  DoD generally complies with current regulations, practices, and decisions of 
independent regulatory bodies.  This policy does not extend to nonindependent regulatory bodies.  
  (2)  Purchases of utility services outside the United States may use—  
   (i)  Formats and technical provisions consistent with local practice; and  
 
  (ii)  Dual language forms and contracts.  
  (3)  Rates established by an independent regulatory body — 
   (i)  Are considered “prices set by law or regulation”;  
   (ii)  Are sufficient to set prices without obtaining certified cost or pricing data 
(see FAR subpart 15.4); and  
   (iii)  Are a valid basis on which prices can be determined fair and reasonable.  
  (4)  Compliance with the regulations, practices, and decisions of independent 
regulatory bodies is not a substitute for the procedures at FAR 41.202(a).</pre>
