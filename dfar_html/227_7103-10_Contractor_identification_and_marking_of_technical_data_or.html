    <h1>227.7103-10 Contractor identification and marking of technical data or</h1>
    <pre>computer software to be delivered  with restrictive markings.  
  (a)  Contractor marking requirements.  Contractors are required to — 
   (1)  Place restrictive markings on the data or software, provide instructions for 
the placement of the restrictive markings, and authorize the use of certain restrictive markings  when restricting the Government’s rights in technical data or computer 
software ; and  
   (2)  Deliver, furnish, or otherwise provide to the Government any technical data 
or computer software in which the Government has previously obtained rights with the 
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
   Government ’s preexisting rights in that data or software , unless restrictions on the 
Government ’s rights have expired.  When restrictions still apply , the contractor is 
permitted to mark the data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for 
which the data or software qualified.  
  (b)  Unmarked technical data.  (1)  Presume technical  data or computer software 
delivered or otherwise provided with unlimited rights under a contract without restrictive markings may be released or disclosed without restriction.  To the extent 
practicable, if a contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, do not release or disclose the technical data or computer software pending evaluation of the request.  
   (2)  A contractor may request permission to have appropriate legends placed on 
unmarked technical data or computer software at its expense.  The request must be 
received by the contracting officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such data or software, or any extension of that time approved by the contracting officer.  The person making the request must:  
    (i)  Identify the technical data or computer software that should have been 
marked;  
    (ii)  Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the 
proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of technical data or computer software contained in the contract ; and  
    (iii)  Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with 
respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical data or computer software made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.  
   (3)  Contracting officers should grant permission to mark only if the technical 
data or computer software were not distributed outside the Government or were distributed outside the Government with restrictions on further use or disclosure.</pre>
