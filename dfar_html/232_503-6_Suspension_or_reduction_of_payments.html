adjustments required by FAR 32.503- 6(f) and (g) — 
   (i)  Except as provided in paragraph (g)(ii) of this subsection, the contracting 
officer must prepare a supplementary analysis of the contractor&#x27;s request for progress payments and calculate the loss ratio adjustment using the procedures in FAR 32.503 -
6(g). 
   (ii)  The contracting officer may request the contractor to prepare the

original request for progress payment (SF 1443, Contractor&#x27;s Request for Progress Payment,  or computer generated equivalent).</pre>
