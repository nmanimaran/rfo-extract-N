    <h1>227.7103-13 Government  right to review, verify, challenge, and validate</h1>
    <pre>asserted restrictions.  
  (a)  General .  (1)  An offeror ’s assertion of restrictions on the Government ’s rights to 
use, modify, reproduce, release, or disclose technical data or computer software do not, by themselves, determine the extent of the Government ’s rights in the technical data or 
computer software.   
   (2)  Review asserted restrictions before acceptance of technical data and 
computer software deliverables under a contract.   
   (3)  The contracting officer may challenge asserted restrictions when reasonable 
grounds exist to believe an assertion is not valid.  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
    (b)  Pre-award considerations.   See 227.7103 -3(a) for guidance on pre -award review 
of asserted restrictions.  
 
 (c)  Challenge considerations and presumption .   
   (1)  Requirements to initiate a challenge.  (i)  Contracting officers must  have 
reasonable grounds to challenge the validity of an asserted restriction.  Before issuing a 
challenge to an asserted restriction, carefully consider all available information related  
to the assertion.      (ii)  A need for additional license rights is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for 
requesting information concerning an asserted restriction.  
    (iii)  Follow the procedures at 227.7103 -5(e) when  the Government needs  
additional license rights but has no grounds to challenge an asserted restriction.  
   (2)  Commercial products and commercial services— presumption regarding 
development exclusively at private expense.   
    (i)  Presume that a commercial product or commercial service was developed 
exclusively at private expense whether or not a contractor or subcontractor submits a justification in response to a challenge notice.  Under 10 U.S.C. 3772(a)(1) and 3784 , 
there is  a presumption and procedures regarding validation of asserted restrictions for 
technical data related to commercial products or commercial services on the basis of development exclusively at private expense.   
    (ii)  Do not challenge a contractor’ s assertion that a commercial product or 
commercial service was developed exclusively at private expense unless the Government can specifically state the reasonable grounds to question the validity of the 
assertion.  The challenge notice must  include sufficient information to demonstrate that 
the commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense.   To sustain the challenge, provide information demonstrating that the 
commercial product or commercial service was not developed exclusively at private expense.  
    (ii)  The challenge notice and all related correspondence are  subject to 
handling procedures for classified information and controlled unclassified information.  
    (iv)  A contractor’ s or subcontractor’ s failure to respond to the challenge 
notice cannot be the sole basis for issuing a final decision denying the validity of an asserted restriction.  
  (d)  Challenge and validation .   
   (1)  Challenge period .  Review a sserted restrictions before acceptance of 
technical data or computer software deliverable under the contract.  Challenge 
assertions within six years after final payment under the contract or six years after 
delivery of the data or software, whichever is later.  There is no time limit for 
challenging restrictive markings if the technical data  or computer software — 
    (i)  Are publicly available without restrictions;  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
   (ii)  Have been provided to the United States without restriction;  
    (iii)  Have been otherwise made available without restriction other than a 
release or disclosure resulting from the sale, transfer, or other assignment of interest in the technical data or computer software to another party or the sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to another party; or  
    (iv)  Is the subject of a fraudulently asserted use or release restriction.  
   (2)  Pre-challenge requests for information .   
    (i)  Contracting officers may request the person asserting a restriction to 
furnish a written explanation of the facts and supporting documentation for the assertion in detail to enable the contracting officer to determine  the basis of the 
restrictive markings.  Request additional supporting documentation when the 
explanation does not, in the contracting officer ’s opinion, establish the validity of the 
assertion.  
    (ii)  Consider challenging the assertion when — 
     (A)  The person asserting the restriction fails to respond to the 
contracting officer’ s request for information or additional supporting documentation ; or  
     (B)  The information submitted , or any other available information 
related  to the validity of a restrictive marking , does not justify the asserted restriction.  
   (3)  Transacting matters directly with subcontracts.   Contracting officers should 
permit , after obtaining the contractor’s agreement,  a subcontractor or supplier to 
transact challenge and validation matters directly with the Government when — 
    (i)  A subcontractor’ s or supplier’ s business interests in its technical data or 
computer software would be compromised if the data were disclosed to a higher tier contractor;  
    (ii)  The contractor will unlikely  respond in a timely manner to a challenge , 
and an untimely response would jeopardize a subcontractor’ s or suppliers right to assert 
restrictions; or  
    (iii)  A subcontractor or supplier requests it . 
   (4)  Challenge notice.   
    (i)  Do not issue a challenge notice unless reasonable grounds exist to 
question the validity of an assertion.  For commercial products or commercial services, 
also see paragraph (c)(2) of this section.  
    (ii)  No requirement exists to request information under paragraph (d)(2) of 
this section before issuing a challenge.   
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
      (iii)  Issue challenge  notices , in writing , to the contractor or, after 
consideration of the situations described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the person 
asserting the restriction.   See PGI 227.7103- 13(d)(4)(iii) for procedures regarding 
challenge notices.    
 
  (5)  Extension of response time.  If the contractor submits a written request for 
additional time to prepare a response, the contracting officer will extend the time for 
response as appropriate, in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of the clause at 252.225-
7999.  
   (6)  Contracting officer’ s final decision .  Issue  a final decision for each challenged 
assertion, whether or not the contractor justified the assertion.  
    (i)  Failure to respond.     If the person asserting the restriction fails to 
respond to the challenge within 60 days or any extension of time the contracting officer granted, issue a final decision that the assertion is not justified as soon as practicable.  
    (ii)  Assertion justified.   If the assertion is determined to be justified based on 
the response to the challenge notice, issue the final decision sustaining the validity of the restriction.  The contracting officer will issue this final decision within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice, or within a longer period that the 
contracting officer has notified the contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.  The contracting officer will provide notification of any longer period for issuance of a final decision within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.  The Contracting Officer will provide notification of any longer period for 
issuance of a final decision within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.  If the contractor made the asserted restriction subsequent to submitting its 
offer, then add the asserted restriction to the contract attachment.  
 
   (iii)  Assertion not justified.   If the assertion is determined not to be justified 
based on the information provided, i ssue a final decision.   The decision must be issued 
within 60 days after recei pt of the response to the challenge notice, or within a longer 
period that the contracting officer has notified the contractor or subcontractor that the Government will require.   The Contracting Officer will provide notification of any longer 
period for issuance of a final decision within 60 days after receipt of the response to the challenge notice.   As provided in paragraph (h) of the  clause, the Government is 
obligated to continue to respect the asserted restrictions through final disposition of any appeal unless the agency head notifies the person asserting the restriction tha t urgent 
or compelling circumstances dictate otherwise . 
   (7)  Multiple challenges to an asserted restriction .  When more than one 
contracting officer challenges an asserted restriction, the contracting officer who made the earliest challenge is responsible for coordinating the Government challenges.  That 
contracting officer must  consult with all other contracting officers making challenges, 
verify that all challenges apply to the same asserted restriction and, after consulting with the contractor, subcontractor, or supplier asserting the restriction, issue a s chedule 
that provides that person a reasonable opportunity to respond to each challenge.  
   (8)  Validation .  Only a contracting officer’ s final decision, actions of an agency 
board of contract appeals , or a court of competent jurisdiction  sustaining  the validity of 
an asserted restriction , constitutes  validation of the asserted restriction.
