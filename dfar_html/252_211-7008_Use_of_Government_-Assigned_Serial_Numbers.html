    <h1>252.211-7008 Use of Government -Assigned Serial Numbers</h1>
    <pre>As prescribed in 211.274-5 (b), use the following clause:  
 
USE OF GOVERNMENT- ASSIGNED SERIAL NUMBERS (SEP 2010)  
 
 (a)  Definitions .  As used in this clause — 
 
  “Government- assigned serial number” means a combination of letters or 
numerals in a fixed human- readable information format (text) conveying information 
about a major end item, which is  provided to a contractor by the requiring activity with 
accompanying technical data instructions for marking the Government -assigned serial 
number on major end items to be delivered to the Government.  
   “Major end item” means a final combination of component parts and/or 
materials which is ready for its intended use and of such importance to operational readiness that review and control of inventory management functions (procurement, distribution, maintenance, disposal, and asset reporting) is required at all levels of life cycle management.   Major end items include aircraft; ships; boats; motorized wheeled, 
tracked, and towed vehicles for use on highway or rough terrain; weapon and missile 
end items; am munition; and sets, assemblies, or end items having a major end item as a 
component . 
   “Unique item identifier (UII)” means a set of data elements permanently 
marked on an item that is globally unique and unambiguous and never changes in order to provide traceability of the item throughout its total life cycle.  The term includes a concatenated UII or a DoD -recognized unique identification equivalent.  
 
 (b)  The Contractor shall mark the Government -assigned serial numbers on those 
major end items as specified by line item in the Schedule, in accordance with the 
technical instructions for the placement and method of application identified in the terms and conditions of the contract.  
  (c)  The Contractor shall register the Government -assigned serial number along with 
the major end item’s UII at the time of delivery in accordance with the provisions of the clause at DFARS 252.211- 7003
(d). 
  (d)  The Contractor shall establish the UII for major end items for use throughout 
the life of the major end item.  The Contractor may elect, but is not required, to use the Government -assigned serial number to construct the UII.
