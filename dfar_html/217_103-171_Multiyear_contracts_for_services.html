    <pre>(a)  The head of the agency has the authority to enter into  multiyear contract s for a 
period of not more than 5 years for covered  services and items of supply relating to such

  (1)  Operation, maintenance, and support of facilities and installations;  
   (2)  Maintenance or modification of aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other highly 
complex military equipment;  
   (3)  Specialized training requiring high quality instructor skills (e.g., training for 
pilots and aircrew members or foreign language training);  
   (4)  Base services (e.g., ground maintenance, in -plane refueling, bus 
transportation, and refuse collection and disposal); and  
   (5)  Environmental remediation services for — 
    (i)  An active military installation;  
    (ii)  A military installation being closed or realigned under a base closure 
law as defined in 10 U.S.C. 2667(h)(2); or  
    (iii)  A site formerly used by DoD (10 U.S.C. 3531(b)).  
  (b)  See PGI 217.103- 171(b) for considerations for using multiyear contracts for 
services.  
  (c)  Before entering into a multiyear contract for services, the head of the agency 
must make a written determination that  
   (1)  There will be a continuing requirement for the services  that is  consistent 
with current plans for the proposed contract period;  
   (2)  Furnishing the services will require  
    (i)  A substantial initial investment in plant or equipment; or  
    (ii)  The incurrence of substantial  contingent liabilities for the assembly, 
training, or transportation of a specialized work force; and    (3)  Using a multiyear contract will promote the best interests of the United 
States by encouraging effective competition and promoting economies in operations (10 U.S.C. 3531(a)).  
  (d)  The head of an agency may not initiate a multiyear contract for services if the 
value of the multiyear contract exceeds $ 900 million unless specifically authorized by  
law (10 U.S.C. 3531(d)(2)).</pre>
