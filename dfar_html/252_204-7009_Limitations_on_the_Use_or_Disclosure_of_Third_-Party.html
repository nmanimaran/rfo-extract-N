  Controlled technical information  means technical information with military or

order and provided to the contractor by or on behalf of DoD in support of the performance of the contract; or  
   (2)  Collected, developed, received, transmitted, used, or stored by or on 
behalf of the contractor in support of the performance of the contract.  
  Cyber incident  means actions taken through the use of computer networks that 
result in a compromise or an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing therein.  
  Information system means a discrete set of information resources organized for 
the collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of information.
