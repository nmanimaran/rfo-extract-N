    <pre>(b)  Establishing performance- based finance payment amounts.  
   (i)  The contracting officer should include in a solicitation both the progress 
payments and performance -based payments provisions and clauses prescribed in this 
part, when considering both types of payment methods.  Only one type of financing will be in cluded in the resultant contract, except as may be authorized on separate orders 
subject to FAR 32.1003(c)).  
   (ii)  The contracting officer must  analyze the performance -based payment 
schedule using the performance -based payments (PBP) analysis tool.  The PBP analysis  
tool is on the Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy website in the Price,  
Cost and Finance  section .  The PBP analysis tool and  Performance Based Payment 
Guidebook are available at 
https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/pcf/pricing -
topics.html#pdp .

    (A)  When considering performance -based payments, obtain from the 
offeror/contractor a proposed performance -based payments schedule that includes all 
performance -based payments events, completion criteria and event values along with 
the projected monthl y expenditure profile in order to negotiate the value of the 
performance events such that the performance -based payments are not expected to 
result in an unreasonably low or negative level of contractor investment in the contract.   
If performance -based pay ments are deemed practical, the Government will evaluate 
and negotiate the details of the performance- based payments schedule.  
 
   (B)  For modifications to contracts that already use performance -based 
payments financing, the basis for negotiation must include performance -based 
payments.  The PBP analysis tool will be used in the same manner to help determine the price for the modi fication;  
   (iii)  The contracting officer must  document in the contract file that the 
performance -based payment schedule provides a mutually beneficial settlement 
position that reflects adequate consideration to the Government for the improved contractor cash flow.  
  (c)  Instructions for multiple appropriations.  If the contract contains foreign military 
sales requirements, the contracting officer must  provide instructions for distribution of 
the contract financing payments to each country’s account.</pre>
