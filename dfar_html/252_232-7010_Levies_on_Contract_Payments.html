            (3)   Advice as to whether the inability to perform may adversely affect national 
security, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation.  
  
      (c)  DoD shall promptly review the Contractor’s assessment, and the Procuring 
Contracting Officer shall provide a written notification to the Contractor including – 
  
      (1)  A statement as to whether DoD agrees that the levy may result in an inability to 
perform the contract; and   
      (2)(i)  If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract and the lack of 
performance will adversely affect national security, the total amount of the monies collected that should be returned to the Contractor; or  
  
           (ii)  If the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract but will not
