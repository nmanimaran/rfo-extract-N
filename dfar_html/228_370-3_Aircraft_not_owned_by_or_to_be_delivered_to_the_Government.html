    <h1>228.370-3 Aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the Government</h1>
    <pre>(a)  When a contract involves aircraft not owned by or to be delivered to the 
Government, the contracting officer may use the clause at 252.228- 7001 o
nly if the 
contracting officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government.  
  (
b)  Potential factors for the contracting officer to consider when deciding which 
course of action is in the best interest of the Government include, but are not limited to, whether — 
   (1)  The cost of hull insurance exceeds the replacement cost of the aircraft;  
   (2)  Insurance is not available (e.g., high- risk experimental flights and 
operations of aircraft in a war zone); or  
   (3)  Ground or flight activities that involve contractor -owned and contractor -
operated aircraft may pose risk to Government aircraft (e.g., due to close proximity in flight).</pre>
