    <h1>232.007 Contract financing payments</h1>
    <pre>(a)  DoD policy is to make contract financing payments as quickly as possible.  
Generally, the contracting officer must  insert the standard due dates of 7 days for 
progress payments, and 14 days for performance -based payments and interim 
payments on cost -type contracts, in the appropriate paragraphs of the respective 
payment clauses.  For interim payments on cost -reimburse ment contracts for 
services, see 232.906(a)(i).  
  (b)  The contracting officer should coordinate contract financing payment terms 
with offices that will be involved in the payment process to ensure that specified terms can be met.  Where justified, the contracting officer may insert a due date greater th an, but not less than, the standard.  In determining payment terms, 
consider — 
   (i)  Geographical separation;  
   (ii)  Workload;  
   (iii)  Contractor ability to submit a proper request; and 
   (iv)  Other factors that could affect timing of payment.</pre>
