    <h1>PGI 217.7405 Plans and reports</h1>
    <pre>By October 31 and April 30 of each year, departments and agencies must prepare  a 
Consolidated UCA Management Report, identifying each UCA /UCO  with a value exceeding 
$5 million.  In addition, departments and agencies must  submit to the Office of the Principal 
Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (Contract Policy) a copy of the 
record of weighted guidelines for each definitized UCA with a value of $100 million or more.  If there is no record of weighted guidelines (e.g., not required for a cost plus award fee contract per DFARS  215.409), then departments and agencies must submit alternative 
documentation that addresses appropriate recognition of the contractor’s reduced cost risk during the undefinitized performance period.  Submit the required information via email to 
osd.pentagon.ousd-a- s.mbx.asda- dp-c- contractpolicy@mail.mil
