    <h1>234.201 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(1) Applicability .  Except for the exemption at paragraph (10) of this section, DoD 
applies the earned value management system requirement as follows:

748).  
 
  (ii) For cost or incentive contracts and subcontracts valued at $100 million or  
more, the clause at 252.234- 7999, Earned Value Management System , requires the 
contractor to have an earned value management system that the cognizant Federal agency has determined to comply with the guidelines in EIA -748.

million — 
    (A) The application of earned value management is optional and is a risk -
based decision;  
    (B) Document the decision to apply earned value management in the 
contract file; and  
    (C) Follow the procedures at PGI 234.201(1)(iii) for conducting a cost -benefit

  (2) Review Procedures.  When an offeror proposes a plan for compliance with the 
earned value management system guidelines in EIA -748, follow the review procedures 
at PGI 234.201(2).  
 
 (3) Defense Contract Management Agency Responsibility.  The Defense Contract

  (4) Additional Guidance.  See PGI 234.201(3) for additional guidance on earned value 
management.  
  (5) Acceptability.  The cognizant contracting officer, in consultation with the

   (i) Determine the acceptability of the contractor&#x27;s earned value management 
system and approve or disapprove the system; and  
   (ii) Pursue correction of any weaknesses or deficiencies.  
  (6) Compliance with System Criteria.  In evaluating the acceptability of a contractor&#x27;s 
earned value management system, the contracting officer, in consultation with the functional specialist and auditor, must determine whether the contractor&#x27;s earned value management system complies with the  system criteria for an acceptable earned value 
management system as prescribed in the clause at 252.234- 7999, Earned Value 
Management System.  
  (7) Disposition of findings .  (i) Reporting of findings.   The functional specialist or 
auditor must document and report all findings and recommendations to the contracting officer. If the functional specialist or auditor identifies any material weakness in the 
contractor&#x27;s earned value management system, the re port must include detailed 
descriptions of the weaknesses or deficiencies.  
   (ii) Initial determination. (A) The contracting officer must review all findings 
and recommendations and, if no material weaknesses exist, must promptly notify the contractor, in writing, that the contractor&#x27;s earned value management system is acceptable and approved; or  
    (B) If the contracting officer finds that one or more material weaknesses 
exist due to the contractor&#x27;s failure to meet one or more of the earned value management system criteria in the clause at 252.234 -7999, the contracting officer 
must — 
     (1) Promptly make an initial written determination of any material 
weaknesses and notify the contractor, in writing, providing a description of each material weakness in sufficient detail to allow the contractor to understand the weaknesses (see PGI 234.201(7 )(ii)); 
     (2) Request the contractor to respond, in writing, to the initial

determination and notify the contractor, in writing, that — 
     (1) The contractor&#x27;s earned value management system is acceptable and 
approved, and no material weaknesses remain; or  
     (2) Material weaknesses remain.  The contracting officer must identify 
any remaining material weaknesses and indicate the adequacy of any proposed or completed corrective action, and — 
      (i) Request that the contractor, within 45 days of receipt of the final 
determination, either correct the deficiencies or submit an acceptable corrective action plan showing milestones and actions to eliminate the weaknesses;  
      (ii) Disapprove the system in accordance with the clause at 252.234-
7999 when initial validation is not successfully completed within the timeframe 
approved by the contracting officer, or the contracting officer determines that the existing earned value management system contains one or more material weaknesses in high- risk gu idelines in EIA -748 standards (guidelines 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 21, 
23, 26, 27, 28, 30, or 32).  
      (iii) When the contracting officer determines that the existing 
earned value management system contains one or more material weaknesses in one or more of the remaining 16 guidelines in EIA -748 standards, the contracting officer must 
use discretion to disapprove the system based on input received from functional specialists and the auditor; and  
      (iv) Withhold payments in accordance with the clause at 252.242 -
7005, Contractor Business Systems, if the clause is included in the contract.
