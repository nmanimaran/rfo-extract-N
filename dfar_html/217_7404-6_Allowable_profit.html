    <h1>217.7404-6 Allowable profit</h1>
    <pre>When the final price of a UCA is negotiated after a substantial portion of the required 
performance has been completed, the head of the contracting activity will  ensure the 
profit allowed reflects — 
  (a)  Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs incurred during contract 
performance before negotiation of the final price.  However, if a contractor submits a qualifying proposal to definitize a UCA , and the contracting officer for such action 
definitizes the contract after the end of the 180 -day period beginning on the date on 
which the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal, the profit allowed on the contract must accurately reflect the cost risk of the contractor as such risk existed on 
the date the contractor submitted the qualifying proposal;  
  (b)  Any reduced cost risk to the contractor for costs expected to be incurred during 
performance of the remainder of the contract after negotiation of the final price; and  
  (c)  The requirements at  215.409  (see PGI 217.7404- 6).  Document the  risk 
assessment in the price negotiation memorandum.</pre>
