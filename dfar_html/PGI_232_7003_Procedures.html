    <h1>PGI 232.7003 Procedures</h1>
    <pre>(a)  DoD officials receiving payment requests in electronic form must  process the 
payment requests in electronic form.  The WAWF system provides the method to electronically process payment requests and receiving reports.  
   (1)  Documents necessary for payment, such as receiving reports, invoice 
approvals, contracts, contract modifications, and required certifications, must be processed 
in electronic form.  
 
  (2)  Scanned documents and other commonly used file formats are only acceptable 
for processing supporting documentation.  
 
 (b)  If one of the exceptions to submission in electronic form at 232.7002(a) applies, the 
contracting officer must— 
   (1)  Consult the payment office and the contract administration office regarding the 
alternative method to be used for submission of payment requests or receiving reports (e.g., facsimile or conventional mail); and    (2)  Provide procedures for invoicing in the contract administration data section of 
the contract or task or delivery order (e.g., section G, an addendum to FAR 52.212- 4, or 
applicable clause) for submission of invoices by nonelectronic means.  If submis sion of 
invoices by nonelectronic means is temporary, the procedures should specify the time period for which they apply.</pre>
