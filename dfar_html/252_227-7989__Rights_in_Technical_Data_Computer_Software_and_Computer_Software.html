   deliver under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to 
restriction.  Except as provided in paragraph (g)(8) of this clause, only the following 
markings are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights marking 
at paragraph (g)(3) of this clause; the limited rights legend at paragraph (g)(4) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (g)(5) of this clause; the SBIR/STTR data rights legend at paragraph (g)(6) of this clause; or the special license rig hts legend 
at paragraph (g)(7) of this clause; and a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings.  The authorized legends 
shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted.  When only portions of a page of printed 
material ar e subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by 
circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier.  Technical data or 
computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions.  However, instructions that 
interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer ’s written permission to deliver such 
software has been obtained prior to delivery.  Reproductions of technical data, computer 
software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.  
   (2)  Omitted markings.   (i)  Technical data, computer software, or computer 
software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under this contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights.  
To the extent practicable, if the Contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this clause) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, the Contracting Officer will not release or disclose the technical data, software, or documentat ion 
pendi ng evaluation of the request.  
    (ii)  The Contractor may request permission to have conforming and justified 
restrictive markings placed on unmarked technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation at its expense.  The request must be received by the 
Contracting Officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such technical data, software, or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the Contracting Officer.  The Contractor shall — 
     (A)  Identify the technical data, software, or documentation that should 
have been marked;  
     (B)  Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the 
proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation contained in this clause; and

       (C)  Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with 
respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical data, software, or 
documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission 
of the marking.

appropriate restrictive legend for which the  data or software qualified under the prior 
contract or license.  The Contractor shall follow the marking procedures in parag raph 
(g)(1) of this clause.  
  (h)  Contractor procedures and records.   Throughout performance of this contract, 
the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall —

 2026 -O0036  
 27 
    (A)  Use the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7989 , Rights in Technical Data, 
Computer Software, and Computer Software Documentation —Other Than Commercial 
Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data related  to other than 
commercial products or commercial services or to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and use the clause at DFARS 252.227- 7990 , Technical Data —Commercial Products and 
Commercial Services, to govern the technical data related  to any portion of a 
commercial product or commercial service that was developed exclusively at private expense;  
     (B)  Use the DFARS clause at 252.227- 7989 , Rights in Technical Data, 
Computer Software, and Computer Software Documentation —Other Than Commercial 
Products and Commercial Services, to govern other than commercial computer software and computer software documentation; and  
     (C)  Use the license under which the data are customarily provided to 
the public, in accordance with DFARS 227.7202, for commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation.

Contractor’ s, or a higher tier subcontractor’ s or supplier’ s rights in a subcontractor’ s or 
supplier’ s technical data or computer software.  
   (3)  Technical data the Contractor must deliver by a subcontractor or supplier 
shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  
However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical 
data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  
   (4)  The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use 
their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.  
   (5)  In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect 
subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.
