    <h1>203.170 Business practices</h1>
    <pre>To ensure the separation of functions for oversight, source selection, contract negotiation, and contract award, departments and agencies must  adhere to the 
following best practice policies:  
  (a)  Senior leaders must  not perform multiple roles in source selection for a major 
weapon system or major service acquisition.  
  (b)  Vacant acquisition positions must be filled on an “acting” basis from below until 
a permanent appointment is made.  To provide promising professionals an opportunity

 03 
   to gain experience by temporarily filling higher positions, these oversight duties must  
not accrue  at the top.  
 
 (c)  Acquisition process reviews of the military departments must  be conducted to 
assess and improve acquisition and management processes, roles, and structures.  The 
scope of the reviews should include—  
 
(1)  Distribution of acquisition roles and responsibilities among personnel;  
   (2)  Processes for reporting concerns about unusual or inappropriate actions; and 
   (3)  Application of DoD Instruction 5000.2, Operation of the Defense Acquisition 
System, and the disciplines in the Defense Acquisition Guidebook.  
  (d)  Source selection processes must  be— 
   (1)  Reviewed and approved by cognizant organizations responsible for 
oversight;  
   (2)  Documented by the head of the contracting activity or at the agency level; 
and 
   (3)  Periodically reviewed by outside officials independent of that office or 
agency.  
  (e)  Legal review of documentation of major acquisition system source selection must  
be conducted prior to contract award, including the supporting documentation of the source selection evaluation board, source selection advisory council, and source selection authority.  
  (f)  Procurement management reviews must  determine whether clearance threshold 
authorities are clear and must provide  independent review for acquisitions exceeding 
the simplified acquisition threshold.</pre>
