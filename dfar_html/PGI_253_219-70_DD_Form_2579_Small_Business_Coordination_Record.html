developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of the protégé firms to perform as subcon tractors and suppliers.  DoD may provide the mentor firm with either cost 
reimbursement or credit against applicable subcontracting goals established under contracts with DoD or other Federal agencies.  
  (c)  DoD will measure the overall success of the Program by the extent to which the 
Program results in — 
 
  (1)  An increase in the dollar value of contract and subcontract awards to 
protégé firms (under DoD contracts, contracts awarded by other Federal agencies, and commercial contracts) from the date of thei r entry into the Program until 5  years after 
the conclusion of the agreement;  
   (2)  An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a 
protégé firm (or former protégé firm) by its mentor firm (or former mentor firm);  
   (3)  An increase in protégé participation in DoD science and technology 
programs; and  
   (4)  An increase in job creation of protégé firms from the date of execution of the 
mentor -protégé agreement until 5 years after completion of the mentor -protégé 
agreement.  
  (d)  This policy sets forth the procedures for participation in the Program applicable 
to companies that are interested in receiving — 
   (1)  Reimbursement through a separate contract line item in a DoD contract or a  
separate contract with DoD; or  
   (2)  Credit toward applicable subcontracting goals for costs incurred under the 
Program.

The purpose of the advance agreement is to establish the accounting treatment of the costs of the developmental assistance pursuant to the mentor -protégé agreement prior 
to the incurring of any costs by the mentor firm.  An advance agreement is an attem pt 
by bot h the Government and the mentor firm to avoid possible subsequent dispute 
based on questions related to reasonableness, allocability, or allowability of the costs of developmental assistance under the Program.  Absent an advance agreement, mentor firms are  advised to establish the accounting treatment of such costs and to address the 
need for any changes to their cost accounting practices that may result from the implementation of a mentor -protégé agreement, prior to incurring any costs, and 
irrespective of  whether costs will be reimbursed or credited.  
  (f)  Developmental assistance provided under an approved mentor- protégé 
agreement is distinct from, and must not duplicate, any effort that is the normal and expected product of the award and administration of the mentor firm&#x27;s subcontracts.  Costs associated with the latter must be accumulated and charged in accordance with the contractor&#x27;s approved accounting practices; they are not considered developmental assistance costs eligible for either credit or reimbursement under the Program.  
  (g)  The agreement shall demonstrate, through its execution, how it will contribute 
to the overall mission of DoD and/or fill or address an identified critical gap or 
 2026- O0037  
 vulnerability.  Focus areas include, but are not limited to, manufacturing, research and 
development, and knowledge- based services.

  (a)  The name, address, e mail address, and telephone number of the mentor and 
protégé points of contact;

 I-110.1  Program provisions applicable to credit agreements.  
  (a)  Developmental assistance costs incurred by a mentor firm for providing 
assistance to a protégé firm pursuant to an approved credit mentor -protégé agreement 
may be credited as if the costs  were incurred under a subcontract award to that protégé,

applicable subcontracting goal established under any contract containing a subcontracting plan pursuant to the clause at FAR 52.219 -9, Small Business 
Subcontracting Plan , or the provisions of the DoD Test Program for Negotiation of 
Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Plans .  Unreimbursed developmental

business subcontracting goal, even if the protégé firm is not a small disadvantaged business concern.  
  (b)  C osts that have been reimbursed through inclusion in indirect expense pools 
may also be credited as subcontract awards for determining the performance of the mentor firm in attaining an applicable subcontracting goal established under any contract containin g a subcontracting plan.  However, costs that have not been

recognized for credit only if requested, identified, and incorporated in an approved 
mentor -protégé agreement.

through actual subcontract awards declined from the prior fiscal year without justifiable cause; and

abuse of this incentive for the mentor firm&#x27;s participation in the Program.  
 
 (b)  The mentor firm must be afforded the opportunity to explain the decline in small 
business subcontract awards before imposition of any such limitation on credit.  In making the final decision to impose a limitation on credit, the Director, O SBP,

years and the total amount of subcontract awards under such contracts; and    (3)  Such other information the mentor firm may wish to submit.

  (b)  For reimbursable agreements, mentors must also send copies of any termination 
to the program manager and to the contracting officer.  
  (c)  Termination of a mentor -protégé agreement will not impair the obligations of the 
mentor firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under Government contracts and subcontracts.

obligations of the protégé firm to perform pursuant to its contractual obligations under any contract awarded to the prot égé firm by the mentor firm.

developed in compliance with I -107(l) through ( n).
