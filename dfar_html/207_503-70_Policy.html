    <pre>(a)  Agency Determinations .  The written determination required by FAR 7.503(e) 
must — 
   (1)  Be prepared using DoD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for Determining

   (1)  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4508, the head of an agency may enter into a 
contract for performance of the acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions that are listed at FAR 7.503(d) only if — 
    (i)  The contracting officer determines that appropriate military or civilian 
DoD personnel — 
     (A)  Cannot reasonably be made available to perform the functions;  
     (B)  Will oversee contractor performance of the contract; and  
     (C)  Will perform all inherently governmental functions associated with 
the functions to be performed under the contract; and  
    (ii)  The contracting officer ensures that the agency addresses any potential 
organizational conflict of interest of the contractor in the performance of the functions under the contract (see FAR Subpart 9.5).
