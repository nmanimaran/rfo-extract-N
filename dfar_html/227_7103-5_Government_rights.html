    <h1>227.7103-5 Government rights</h1>
    <pre>The standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are unlimited 
rights, government purpose rights, limited rights, or restricted rights.  In unusual 
situations, the standards rights may not satisfy the Government ’s needs,  or the 
Government may be willing to accept lesser rights in data or computer software in return for other consideration.   In those cases, a special license may be negotiated.  
However, the licensor is not obligated to provide the Government greater rights,  and 
the contracting officer is not required to accept lesser rights than the rights provided in the standard grant of license.  The situations under which a particular grant of license 
applies are listed  in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.  
  (a)  Unlimited rights .  The Government obtains unlimited rights in technical data, 
computer software, or computer software documentation that are — 
   (1)  Technical d ata related  to an item, component, or process which has been or 
will be developed exclusively with Government funds;  
   (2)  Studies, analyses, test data, or similar data produced in the performance of 
a contract when the study, analysis, test, or similar work was specified as an element of performance;  
   (3)  Created exclusively with Government funds in the performance of a contract 
that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes;

   (6)  Corrections or changes to — 
    (i)  Government -furnished technical data;  or 
    (ii)  Government -furnished computer software or computer software 
documentation;  
   (7)  Technical d ata, computer software, or computer software documentation 
that— 
   (i)  Is publicly available ; or

data or computer software to another party ; or  
     (B)  T he sale or transfer of some or all of a business entity or its assets to 
another party;  
   (8)  Technical d ata, computer software , or computer software documentation  in 
which the Government has obtained unlimited rights under another Government 
contract or as a result of negotiations; or  
   (9)  Technical d ata, computer software, or computer software documentation  
furnished to the Government, under a Government contract or subcontract , with—  
    (i)  Restricted rights in computer software, limited rights in technical data, 
or government purpose license rights and the restrictive conditions have expired; or

such technical data or computer software  for commercial purposes has expired.  
 
(10)  Computer software developed exclusively with Government funds;  or 
 (11)  Computer software documentation the contractor must deliver under a 
Government contract . 
  (b)  Government purpose rights.  (1)  The Government obtains government purpose 
rights in — 
    (i)  Technical data related  to items, components, or processes developed with 
mixed funding except when the Government is entitled to unlimited rights as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(4) through (9) of this section; or  
 2026 -O0036

   (ii)  Technical data created with mixed funding in the performance of a 
contract that does not require the development, manufacture, construction, or production of items, components, or processes; or  
    (iii)  Computer software developed with mixed funding.  
   (2)  The period during which government purpose rights are effective is 
negotiable.  A five year period is nominal.   Either the Government or the contractor may 
request a different period.   
   (3)  The government purpose rights period begins  upon execution of the contract , 
subcontract, or similar contractual instrument  that required the development.  Upon 
expiration of the Government rights period, the Government has unlimited rights in the data or software including the right to authorize others to use the data or software for commercial purposes.  
  
  (4)  During the government purpose rights period, the Government may not use, 
or authorize other persons to use, technical data or computer software marked with government purpose rights legends for commercial purposes.  The Government will  not 
release or disclose data or software in which it has government purpose rights to any person, or authorize others to do so, unless — 
    (i)  Prior to release or disclosure, the intended recipient is subject to the use 
and nondisclosure agreement at 227.7103 -7; or

   (5)  When the Government will  release or disclose technical data or computer 
software marked with government purpose rights legends to  a contractor performing 
under a contract that does not include the clause at 252.227 -7994 , modify the contract 
prior to release or disclosure, to include that clause in lieu of requiring the contractor to complete a use and nondisclosure agreement.  
   (6)(i)  Agencies  must  establish procedures to  prevent the release or disclosure of 
marked technical data or computer software with government purpose rights legends  to 
entities that are not subject to use and disclosure restrictions. .  
    (ii)  Public announcements in the System for Award Management or other 
publications must provide notice of the use and nondisclosure requirements.  
    (iii)  Consider using class  use and nondisclosure agreements (e.g., 
agreements covering all solicitations received by the XYZ company within a reasonable period) .  Enter into class  agreements  at any time prior to release or disclosure of the 
government purpose rights data or software.   Documents transmitting government 
purpose rights data or software to persons under class agreements must  identify the 
technical data or computer software subject to government purpose rights and the class agreement providi ng such data or software.

    (ii)  To a covered Government support contractor; or 
    (iii)  To a foreign government, other than detailed manufacturing or process 
data, when use, release, or disclosure is in the interest of the United States and is required for evaluational or informational purposes.  
   (3)  The Government must notify the  person asserting limited rights of its intent 
to release, disclose, or authorize others to use such data prior to release or disclosure of the data , except for emergency repair or overhaul .  For emerg ency repair or overhaul, 
the Government will make the notification as soon as practicable.  
   (4)  If the person asserting limited rights permits the Government to release, 
disclose, or have others use the data subject to restrictions on further use, release, or disclosure, or for a release under paragraph (c)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, the intended recipient must , prior to receiving the limited rights data, either—

 (2)(i)  Contractors  are not required to provide the Government additional rights 
in computer software delivered or otherwise provided to the Government with restricted rights.  
   (ii)  When the Government has a need for additional rights, negotiate with 
the contractor to determine acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  Any resulting

 (e)  Specifically negotiated license rights.  (1)(i)  Negotiate specific licenses when the 
parties agree to modify the standard license rights granted to the Government or when 
the Government needs  to obtain rights in data or software in which it does not have 
rights.  
 
   (ii)  When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government ’s 
rights in technical data, consider the acquisition strategy for the item, component, or process, including logistics support and other factors relevant to a particular 
procurement.  
    (iii)  When negotiating to obtain, relinquish, or increase the Government ’s 
rights in computer software, consider the planned software maintenance philosophy, anticipated time or user sharing requirements, and other factors relevant to a 
particular procurement.  
    (iv)  The Government may accept lesser rights when it has unlimited or 
government purpose rights in data or software but may not accept less than limited rights or restricted rights in such data or software, respectively.  
    (v)  The negotiated license rights must stipulate what rights the 
Government has to release or disclose the data or software to other persons or to authorize others to use the data or software.  
    (vi)  Identify all negotiated rights in a license agreement  that are  made part 
of the contract.  
   (2)(i)  When the Government needs additional rights in data or software 
acquired with government purpose, limited rights, or restricted rights, negotiate with 
the contractor to determine acceptable terms for transferring such rights.  Generally, 
conduct such negotiations only when—  
     (A)  A need exists to disclose the data or software outside the 
Government ; or  
     (B)  The  additional rights are required for competitive reprocurement 
and the anticipated savings through competition  will likely  exceed the acquisition cost 
of the additional rights.  
    (ii)  Prior to negotiating for additional rights in limited rights data, consider 
alternatives such as — 
     (A)  Using performance specifications and form, fit, and function data to 
acquire or develop functionally equivalent items, components, or processes;  
     (B)  Obtaining a contractor’ s contractual commitment to qualify 
additional sources and maintain adequate competition among the sources; or  
     (C)  Reverse engineering, or  providing items from Government 
inventories to contractors who request the items to facilitate the development of equivalent items through reverse engineering.
