    <h1>240.370-3 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(a)(1)   Contractors and subcontractors are required to provide adequate security 
on all covered contractor information systems  in accordance with  32 CFR 2002 and 
the clause at  252.204 -7012.  
 2026- O0025

   (2)  High NIST SP 800 -171 DoD Assessments will be conducted by 
Government personnel using NIST SP 800 -171A, “Assessing Security Requirements 
for Controlled Unclassified Information.”  
 
  (3)  The Medium or High NIST SP 800 -171 DoD Assessments will use the 
scoring methodology described  in 32 CFR 170.24.  
   (4)  The Medium or High  NIST SP 800 -171 DoD Assessment s will not 
duplicate efforts from any other DoD assessment or the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) (see 240. 371), except for rare circumstances when a 
new assessment may be necessary, such as, but not limited to, when cybersecurity 
risks, threats, or awareness have changed, requiring a new assessment to ensure 
current compliance.  
  (b)  Contractors and subcontractors are required to rapidly report cyber incidents 
directly to DoD at http://dibnet.dod.mil .  Subcontractors provide the incident 
report number automatically assigned by DoD to the prime contractor.  Lower -tier 
subcontractors likewise report the incident report number automatically assigned by DoD to their higher -tier subcontractor, until the prime contractor is reached.  
   (1)  If a cyber incident occurs, contractors and subcontractors submit to 
DoD— 
    (i)  A cyber incident report;  
 
   (ii)  Malicious software, if detected and isolated; and  
    (iii)  Media (or access to covered contractor information systems and 
equipment) upon request.  
   (2)  Contracting officers must  refer to PGI 240.370- 9(c) for instructions on 
contractor submissions of media and malicious software.  
  (c)  Information shared by the contractor may include contractor 
attributional/proprietary information that is not customarily shared outside of the company, and that the unauthorized use or disclosure of such information could cause substantial competitive har m to the contractor that reported the information .  
The Government must  protect against the unauthorized use or release of 
information that includes contractor attributional/proprietary information.  
  (d)  A cyber incident that is reported by a contractor or subcontractor must  not, 
by itself, be interpreted as evidence that the contractor or subcontractor has failed to provide adequate security on their covered contractor information systems or  has 
otherwise failed to meet the requirements of the clause at 252.204 -7012, 
Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting .  When a 
cyber incident is reported, the contracting officer must  consult with the DoD 
component Chief Information Officer/cyber security office prior to assessing contractor compliance (see PGI 240.370- 8(a)(3)) .  The contracting officer must  
consider such cyber incidents in the context of an overall assessment of a contractor&#x27;s compliance with the requirements of the clause at 252.204 -7012.

 (e)  Support services contractors directly supporting Government activities 
related to safeguarding covered defense information and cyber incident reporting (e.g., forensic analysis, damage assessment, or other services that require access to 
data from another contractor) are subject to restrictions on use and disclosure of reported information.</pre>
