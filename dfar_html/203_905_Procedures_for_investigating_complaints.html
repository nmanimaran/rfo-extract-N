    <h1>203.905 Procedures for investigating complaints</h1>
    <pre>(1)  Unless the DoD Inspector General makes a determination that the complaint is 
frivolous, fails to allege a violation of the prohibition in 203.903, or has been previously addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, the DoD Inspector General will investigate the complaint.  
  (2)  If the DoD Inspector General investigates the complaint, the DoD Inspector 
General will—  
   (i)  Notify the complainant, the contractor alleged to have committed the 
violation, and the head of the agency; and  
   (ii)  Provide a written report of findings to the complainant, the contractor 
alleged to have committed the violation, and the head of the agency.  
  (3)  Upon completion of the investigation, the DoD Inspector General—  
   (i)  Either will determine that the complaint is frivolous, fails to allege a 
violation of the prohibition in 203.903, or has been previously addressed in another Federal or State judicial or administrative proceeding initiated by the complainant, or will submit the report addressed in paragraph (2) of this section within 180 days after receiving the complaint; and

  (4)  The DoD Inspector General may not respond to any inquiry or disclose any 
information from or about any person alleging the reprisal, except to the extent that such response or disclosure is — 
   (i)  Made with the consent of the person alleging reprisal;  
   (ii)  Made in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (the Freedom of Information Act) or 
as required by any other applicable Federal law; or  
 
  (iii)  Necessary to investigate  the alleged reprisal.
