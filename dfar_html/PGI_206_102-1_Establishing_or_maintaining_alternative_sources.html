    <h1>PGI 206.102-1 Establishing or maintaining alternative sources</h1>
    <pre>(b)(i)  Include the following information, as applicable, and any other information that may 
be pertinent, in the supporting documentation:  
    (A)  The acquisition history of the supplies or services, including sources, prices, 
quantities, and dates of award . 
    (B)  The circumstances that  make it necessary to exclude the particular source 
from the contract action, including—  
 2026- O0017  
     (1)  The reasons for the lack of or potential loss of alternative sources; e.g., 
the technical complexity and criticality of the supplies or services; and  
 
    (2)  The current annual requirement and projected needs for the supplies or 
services.  
    (C)  Whether the existing source must be totally excluded from the contract 
action or whether a partial exclusion is sufficient.  
    (D)  The potential effect of exclusion on the excluded source in terms of loss of 
capability to furnish the supplies or services in the future . 
    (E)  When FAR 6.102- 1(a)(1)  is the authority, the basis for — 
     (1)  The determination of future competition; and 
     (2)  The determination of reduced overall costs.  Include, as a minimum, a 
discussion of start -up costs, facility costs, duplicative administration costs, economic order 
quantities, and life cycle cost considerations.       
    (F)  When FAR 6.102- 1(a)(2) is the authority — 
 
    (1)  The current annual and mobilization requirements for the supplies or 
services, citing the source of, or the basis for, the data;  
 
    (2)  A comparison of current production capacity with that necessary to meet 
mobilization requirements;  
 
    (3)  An analysis of the risks of relying on the present source; and  
     (4)  A projection of the time required for a new source to acquire the 
necessary facilities and achieve the production capacity necessary to meet mobilization requirements.  
   (ii)  The following is a sample format for Determination and Findings citing the 
authority of FAR 6.102- 1(a): 
Determination and Findings  
 
Authority to Exclude a Source  
 
In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3203 (a)(1), it is my determination that the following contract 
action may be awarded using full and open competition after exclusion of 
____________________*:  
 
(Describe requirement.)  
Findings  
 
The exclusion of _____________________*  
 
Alternate 1:  will increase or maintain competition for this requirement and is expected to 
result in a reduction of $__________ in overall costs for the present and future acquisition 
of these supplies or services.  (Describe how estimate was derived.)  
 
Alternate 2:  is in the interest of national defense because it will result in having a supplier 
available for furnishing these supplies or services in case of a national emergency or 
industrial mobilization.  (Explain circumstances requiring exclusion of source.)  
 
Alternate 3:  is in the interest of national defense because it will result in establishment or 
maintenance of an essential engineering, research or development capability to be 
provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research 
and development center.  (Explain circumstances requiring exclusion of source.)  
 
*  Identify source being excluded.</pre>
