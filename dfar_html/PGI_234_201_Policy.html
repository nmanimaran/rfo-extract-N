    <h1>PGI 234.201 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(1)(iii)  When  the program manager decides to implement earned value management on 
contracts and subcontracts valued at less than $20,000,000, a cost -benefit analysis must be 
conducted and the results documented in the contract file.  Considerations for determining the effectiveness of applying earned value management in these situations and guidance for 
tailoring reporting are available in — 
    (1)  The 
Integrated Program Management Data Analysis Report (IPMDAR) 
Implementation &amp; Tailoring Guide; and 
    (2)  The DoD Earned Value Management Implementation Guide
. 
   (iv)  In extraordinary cases where cost/schedule visibility is required and cannot 
be obtained using other means, the program manager 
must request a waiver for 
individual contracts from the Milestone Decision Authority.  In these cases, the program manager will conduct a business case analysis that includes rationale as to why a cost or fixed- price incentive contract was not an appropriate contracting vehicle.  
Considerations for determining the effectiveness of applying earned value management in these situations and guidance for tailoring reporting can be found in— 
   (1)  DoD Instruction 5000.85, paragraph 3C.3.c.(3)
; and 
   (2)  The DoD Earned Value Management Implementation Guide . 
 
 (2)  The procuring contracting officer must obtain the assistance of the administrative 
contracting officer in determining the adequacy of an earned value management system  
(EVMS) plan that an offeror proposes for compliance with ANSI/EIA -748, under the 
provision at DFARS 252.234- 7001, Notice of Earned Value Management System.  The 
Government will review and approve the offeror’s EVMS plan before contract award.  
Instructions for performing EVMS plan reviews can be found at 
https://www.dcma.mil/HQ/EVMS . 
 (4)  Additional guidance on earned value management can be found in — 
  (A)  The G uidebook for Earned Value Management System (EVMS) System -Level  
Surveillance at https://www.dcma.mil/HQ/EVMS/ ; 
   (B)  The Guidebook for Earned Value Management System - Program Analysis
; and 
   (C)  
The Program Managers’ Guide to the Integrated Baseline Review Process (the 
IBR Guide) . 
  (7)  Disposition of findings . 
   (ii)  Initial determination. 
 34 
   (B)(1 )  Within  30 days of receiving the report, if the contracting officer makes a  
determination that there is a material weakness, the contracting officer should provide an initial determination of material weaknesses and a copy of the report to the contractor and  
require the contractor to submit a written response.  
     ( 3)  Evaluation of contractor&#x27;s response.  Within 30 days of receiving the 
contractor’s response, the contracting officer, in consultation with the auditor or cognizant functional specialist, should evaluate the contractor’s response and make a final determination.  
   (iii)  Final determination. 
    (B)(1 )  Monitoring contractor&#x27;s corrective action.  The contracting officer and 
cognizant functional specialist or auditor must monitor the contractor&#x27;s progress in correcting material weaknesses and deficiencies.  If the contractor fails to make adequate progress, the contracting officer must take whatever action is necessary to ensure that the contractor corrects the weaknesses and deficiencies.  Actions the contracting officer may take include:  withdraw or withhold approval of the system; bringing the issue to the attention of higher level management, as applicable; recommending non- award of potential contracts; and for 
material weaknesses, implementing or increasing the withholding in accordance with 252.242- 7005
, Contractor Business Systems.  
     ( 2)  Correction of material weaknesses . 
      ( i)  When the contractor notifies the contracting officer that the  
contractor has corrected the material weaknesses,  the contracting officer must request the 
cognizant functional specialist or auditor to review the correction to determine whether the weaknesses and deficiencies have been resolved.  
      ( ii)  The contracting officer must determine whether the contractor has 
corrected the weaknesses and deficiencies.  
      ( iii)  If the contracting officer determines the contractor has corrected  
the weaknesses and deficiencies, send the contracting officer’s notification to the cognizant  
functional specialist; auditor; payment office; appropriate action officers responsible for reporting past performance at the requiring activities; and each contracting and contract administration office having substantial business with the contractor as applicable.</pre>
