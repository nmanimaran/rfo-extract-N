percent by weight in any homogenous material; or  
 
   (ii)  Requires the removal or reapplication of  hexavalent chromium materials 
during subsequent sustainment phases of the deliverable or construction material.  
   (2)  This prohibition does not apply to hexavalent chromium produced as a by -
