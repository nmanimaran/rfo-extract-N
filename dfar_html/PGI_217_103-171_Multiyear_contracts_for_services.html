    <h1>PGI 217.103-171 Multiyear contracts for services</h1>
    <pre>(b) The head of the agency must consider the following principles when entering into a 
multiyear contract for services:  
 
  (1)  The portion of the cost of any plant or equipment amortized as a cost of contract 
performance should not exceed the ratio between the period of contract performance and the anticipated useful commercial life of the plant or equipment.  As used in this section, &quot;useful commercial life&quot; means the commercial utility of the facilities rather than the physical life, with due consideration given to such factors as the location, specialized nature, and obsolescence of the facilities.  
   (2)  The desirability of obtaining an option to extend the term of the contract for a 
reasonable period not to exceed 3 years at prices that do not include charges for plant, equipment, or other nonrecurring costs already amortized.  
 
  (3)  The desirability of reserving the right to take title, under the appropriate 
circumstances, to the plant or equipment upon payment of the unamortized portion of the 
cost (10 U.S.C. 3531(c)).</pre>
