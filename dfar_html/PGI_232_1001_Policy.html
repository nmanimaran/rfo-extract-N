    <h1>PGI 232.1001 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Contracting officer action.  Performance -based payments are not practical for use on 
all fixed -price contracts because they  require considerable effort between the contractor and 
Government to identify the appropriate performance- based payment events and establish 
the proper completion criteria for those events.  Additionally, FAR 32.1003 prohibits contracts from having both progress payments and performance -based payment financing on a 
contract at the same time.  Additional information and instruction on performance -based 
payments are provided in the DoD Performance- based Payments Guide on the Defense 
Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (Price, Cost and Finance) website under Pricing  
Topics, Performance Based Payment.  See

training/Performance_Based_Payment_(PBP)_Guide.pdf .
