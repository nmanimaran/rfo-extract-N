    <pre>(a)  The following undefinitized contract actions (UCAs) are not subject to this 
subpart.   However, the contracting officer will apply the policy and procedures to them 
to the maximum extent practicable (also see paragraph (b) of this section):  
   (1)  Purchases at or below the simplified acquisition threshold.  
   (2)  Special access programs.  
   (3)  Congressionally mandated long -lead procurement contracts.  
  (b)  If the contracting officer determines that it is impracticable to adhere to the 
procedures of this subpart for a particular contract action that falls within one of the categories in paragraph (a) of this section, the contracting officer will provide prior 
notice, through agency channels, electronically via email to the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy (Contract Policy), at osd.pentagon.ousd -a-s.mbx.asda -dp-c- contractpolicy@mail.mil
