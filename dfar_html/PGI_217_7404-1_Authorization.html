    <h1>PGI 217.7404-1 Authorization</h1>
    <pre>(1)  The requiring activity, in coordination with the contracting office, prepares the request 
for approval package for an undefinitized contract action (UCA) requirement.  The approval package must — 
   (i)  Document why a UCA is required (for letter contracts see DFARS 216.603);  
   (ii)  Provide a detailed explanation for the need to begin performance before 
definitization;  
   (iii)  Address the adverse impact on agency requirements that would result from 
delays in beginning performance;  
   (iv)  Identify the risk of using a UCA and the means by which the Government will 
mitigate such risk;  
 
  (v )  Identify and justify the specific contractual instrument to be used;  
 
  (vi)  Establish limitations on the obligation of funds; and  
 
  (vii)  Provide the definitization schedule of agreed- upon events that support timely 
definitization.
