    <h1>227.7103-9 Copyright</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Copyright license.  (1)  Contractors are  require d to grant or obtain for the 
Government license rights permitting  the Government to reproduce data, distribute 
copies of the data, software, or software documentation, publicly perform or display the data, software, or software documentation or, through the right to modify data, prepare derivative works.  The extent to which the Government, and others acting on its behalf, 
may exercise these rights varies for each of the standard data rights licenses obt ained 
under the contract.   When  negotiating  non-standard license rights in technical data or 
computer software, negotiate the extent of the copyright license as a part of  the 
negotiations for the data rights license.  Do not negotiate a copyright license that 
provides less rights than the standard limited rights license in technical data or restricted rights license in computer software.  
   (2)  Contractors are not permitted to incorporate  a third party ’s copyrighted data 
into a deliverable data or software item unless the contractor has obtained an appropriate license for the Government and, when applicable, others acting on the 
Government ’s behalf.  Grant approval to use third- party copyrighted data or software in 
which the Government will not receive a copyright license only when the Government ’s 
requirements cannot be satisfied without the third -party material or when the use of 
the third -party material will result in cost savings to the Government which outweigh 
the lack of a copyright license.  
  (b)  Copyright considerations— acquisition of existing and special works.  See 
227.7105 or 227.7106 for copyright considerations when acquiring existing or special works that are not SBIR/STTR data.</pre>
