    <pre>(a)  Before award of a contract under STTR program requirements offerors submit, 
as part of their proposal, a written agreement between the offeror and a research institution that allocates any rights in intellectual property and the offeror ’s written 
representation that the offeror is satisfied with the agreement.  Review  the agreement 
to ensure it does not conflict with the requirements of the solicitation or any right to carry out follow -on research.  If such conflicts exist and cannot be resolved, the 
submitted proposal is not eligible for award.  
  (b)  At contract award for STTR program requirements, attach to the contract the 
accepted written agreement and representation provided by the contractor pursuant to the provision at 252.227- 7998.  
  (c)  After contract award, for any modification to the written agreement between the 
contractor and research institution, review the agreement and representation to ensure the modified agreement adheres to the requirements of 252.227 -7999 .  If acceptable, 
attach the modified agreement to the contract.</pre>
