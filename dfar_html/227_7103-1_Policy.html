    <h1>227.7103-1 Policy</h1>
    <pre>(a)  DoD policy is to acquire only the technical data, computer software, and 
computer software documentation, and the associated rights, necessary to satisfy agency needs.  
  (b)  Contracting officers must ensure that s olicitations and contracts — 
   (1)  Specify the technical data, computer software, and computer software 
documentation the  contractor must deliver under a contract and delivery schedules for 
the data;  
   (2)  Specif y procedures for determining the acceptability of technical data, 
computer software, and computer software documentation;  
   (3)  Specify  separate line items, to the extent practicable, for the technical data, 
computer software, and computer software documentation the  contractor must deliver 
under a contract and require offerors and contractors to price each deliverable data or computer software item  separately ; and  
   (4)  Require offerors  and contractors to identify, to the extent practicable, 
technical data and computer software  they will furnish or deliver with restrictions on 
the Government’s rights  in the technical data or computer software . 
  (c)  Do not require offerors , either as a condition of being responsive to a solicitation 
or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in computer software developed at private expense or technical data related to items, components or processes developed at private expense except for the data or the software identified at 227.7103- 5(a)(2),  (4) through (9), and (12) through (15).  
  (d)  Do not prohibit offerors and contractors  from furnishing or offering to furnish 
computer software, items, components, or processes developed at private expense solely

   because the Government ’s rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or 
disclose computer software or technical data related  to those items may be restricted.  
 
 (e)  Solicitations for major systems development contracts must  not require offerors 
to submit proposals that would permit the Government  to competitively  acquire items 
identical to items developed at private expense unless a  determination is made at a 
level above the contracting officer  (10 U.S.C. 3208).  The determination must address 
the following:  
   (1)  The offeror will not be able to satisfy program schedule or delivery 
requirements . 
   (2)  The offeror ’s proposal to meet mobilization requirements does not satisfy 
mobilization needs.  
  (f)  For acquisitions involving major weapon systems or subsystems of major weapon 
systems, the acquisition plan must  address acquisition strategies that provide for 
technical data, computer software, computer software documentation, and the associated license rights in accordance with 207.106 -70. 
  (g)  The Government ’s rights in a vessel design, and in any useful article embodying 
a vessel design, must be consistent with the Government ’s rights in technical data 
related  to the design (10 U.S.C. 8687; 17 U.S.C. 1301(a)(3)).</pre>
