    <pre>reproduce or disclose  technical data or computer software.  
  (a)(1)(i)  Offerors are required to identify to the contracting officer, prior to contract 
award, any technical data or computer software that the offeror asserts should be 
provided to the Government with restrictions on use, modification, reproduction, release or disclosure.  Offerors are required to attach the notification and identification to their 
offer.   
    (ii)(A)  An offeror ’s failure to submit the attachment or to complete it in 
accordance with the provision —  
      (1)  Constitutes a minor informality  within the meaning of FAR 
part 14; or  
      (2)  Provides reason to seek  clarification within the meaning of FAR 
part 15 .  
     (B)  Provide the offeror an opportunity to remedy the failure  under the 
procedures in FAR part 14 or 15.  If the offeror does not correct the error, its offer  will be  
ineligible for award.  
   (2)(i)  Contracting officers may request information to enable the review and 
evaluation of any offer or-provided assertion.  Resolve questions regarding the validity of 
asserted restrictions prior to contract award.

      (ii)  After award of the contract, use the procedures at 227.7103 -13 to 
evaluate an  asserted restriction or asserted rights category .   
 
  (3)  The Government may use information that offerors provide in response to 
the provision at 252.227- 7992 during source  selection to evaluate the impact of 
restrictions on the Government ’s ability to use or disclose technical data or computer 
software.  Do not — 
    (i)  Prohibit offerors from offering products for which the offeror is entitled to 
provide the technical data or computer software with restrictions; or  
    (ii)  Require offerors, either as a condition of being responsive to a 
solicitation or as a condition for award, to sell or otherwise relinquish rights in technical data or computer software except for the standard rights specified in the applicable clauses.  
   (4)  Attach the successful offeror ’s assertions to the contract unless, in 
accordance with the procedures at 227.7103 -13, the parties have agreed that an 
asserted restriction is not justified.  Validate that the contract attachment contains the 
same information  regarding identification of the technical data, the asserted rights 
category, the basis for the assertion, and the name of the person asserting the restrictions  that the offeror provided in response to the solicitation .  
   (5)  Neither the contractor’ s pre- or post -award assertions, nor the fact that the 
attachment to the contract identifies certain assertions, determine s the respective 
rights of the parties.  As provided at 227.7103 -13, the Government has the right to 
review, verify, challenge and validate restrictive markings.  
  (b)  [Reserved ]  
  (c)  After award of the contract, the contractor may  make additional assertions
