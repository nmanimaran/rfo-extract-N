    <pre>(a)  Award eligibility.  
   (1)  The contracting officer must  include in the solicitation the required 
CMMC level, if provided by the program office or the requiring activity.  
   (2)  Contracting officers must  not award a contract, task order, or delivery 
order to an offeror that does not have a current CMMC status at the CMMC level required by the solicitation.  
   (3)  Contractors are required to achieve, at time of award, a CMMC status at 
the CMMC level specified in the solicitation, or higher, for all information systems used in the performance of the contract, task order, or delivery order that will process, store, or transmit FCI or CUI .  Contractors are required to maintain a 
current CMMC status at the specified CMMC level or higher, if required by the contract, task order, or delivery order, throughout the life of the contract, task order, or delivery order.  
  (b)  CMMC status.    
   (1) Contracting officers may award a contract, task order, delivery order, or 
modification to exercise an option or extend a period of performance, if the offeror&#x27;s or contractor&#x27;s CMMC status is — 
 
   (i)  Listed in the definition of “CMMC status”; and  
    (ii)  Equal to or higher than the CMMC level required by the solicitation 
or contract, task order, or delivery order.  
   (2)  CMMC levels 2 and 3 can be in a conditional level for a period not to 
exceed 180 days from the CMMC status date (32 CFR 170.21), and award can occur with a conditional CMMC level.  CMMC level 1 requires a final CMMC level for 
award.</pre>
