    <h1>207.106-70 Additional requirements for major systems</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Contracting officer s are  prohibited by 10 U.S.C. 3208(d)(1) from requiring offers 
for development or production of major systems that would enable the Government to use technical data to competitively reprocure identical items or components of the system if the item or component were developed exclusively at private expense, unless the contracting officer determines that—    (1)  The original supplier of the item or component will be unable to satisfy 
program schedule or delivery requirements;  
   (2)  Proposals by the original supplier of the item or component to meet 
mobilization requirements are insufficient to meet the agency&#x27;s mobilization needs; or  
   (3)  The Government is otherwise entitled to unlimited rights in technical data.  
  (b )  If the contracting officer makes a determination, under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2)  
of this section, for a competitive solicitation, 10 U.S.C. 3208(d)( 2) requires that the 
evaluation of items developed at private expense be based on an analysis of the total value, in terms of innovative design, life -cycle costs, and other pertinent factors, of 
incorporating such items in the system.  
  (c)   In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3774(a)  and DoD policy requirements, acquisition 
plans for major weapon systems and subsystems of major weapon systems must — 
   (1 )  Assess the long -term technical data and computer software needs of those 
systems and subsystems; and  
   (2 )  Establish acquisition strategies that provide for the technical data 
deliverables and associated license rights needed to sustain those systems and subsystems over their life cycle.  The strategy may include — 
    (i )  The development of maintenance capabilities within DoD; or  
    ( ii)  Competition for contracts for sustainmen t of the systems or subsystems.  
  (d )  Assessments and corresponding acquisition strategies developed under 
paragraph (c) of this section must— 
   (1 )  Be developed before issuance of a solicitation for the weapon system or 
subsystem;  
 
  (2 )  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4328, to emphasize reliability and 
maintainability in weapon system design, ensure that reliability and 
maintainability are included in the performance attributes of the key performance 
parameters on sustainment during the development of capabilities requirements.  
For additional guidance see PGI 207.104- 70; 
   (3 )  Address the merits of including a priced contract option for the future 
delivery of technical data and computer software, and associated license rights, that were not acquired upon initial contract award;  
 07 
  (4 )  Address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over the life cycle 
of the weapon system or subsystem; and  
   (5 )  Apply to weapon systems and subsystems that are to be supported by 
performance -based logistics arrangements as well as to weapon systems and 
subsystems that are to be supported by other sustainment approaches.  
  (e)  See part 209 for policy applicable to acquisition strategies that consider the use 
of lead system integrators.  
  (f)(1)  In accordance with section 202 of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform 
Act of 2009 (Pub. L. 111- 23), acquisition plans for major defense acquisition 
programs as defined in 10 U.S.C. 4201, must  include measures that — 
 
   (i)  Ensure competition, or the option of  competition, at both the prime 
contract level and subcontract level (at such tier or tiers as are appropriate) throughout the program life cycle as a means to improve contractor performance; and  
    (ii)  Document the rationale for the selection of the appropriate subcontract 
tier or tiers under paragraph (f)(1) (i) of this section, and the measures which will be 
employed to ensure competition, or the option of competition.  
 
  (2)  Measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition,  may include, 
but are not limited to, cost- effective measures intended to achieve the following:  
    (i)  Competitive prototyping.  
    (ii)  Dual -sourcing.  
    (iii)  Unbundling of contracts.  
    (iv)  Funding of next -generation prototype systems or subsystems.  
    (v)  Use of modular, open architectures to enable competition for upgrades.  
    (vi)  Use of build -to-print approaches to enable production through multiple 
sources.  
    (vii)  Acquisition of complete technical data packages.  
    (viii)  Periodic competitions for subsystem upgrades.  
    (ix)  Licensing of additional suppliers.  
    (x)  Periodic system or program reviews to address long -term competitive 
effects of program decisions.     (3)  In order to ensure fair and objective “make- or-buy” decisions by prime 
contractors, acquisition strategies and resultant solicitations and contracts must — 
    (i)  Require prime contractors to give full and fair consideration to qualified 
 07 
 sources other than the prime contractor for the development or construction of major 
subsystems and components of major weapon systems;  
    (ii)  Provide for Government surveillance of the process by which prime 
contractors consider such sources and determine whether to conduct such development or construction in -house or through a subcontract; and  
    (iii)  Provide for the assessment of the extent to which the prime contractor 
has given full and fair consideration to qualified sources in sourcing decisions as a part of past performance evaluations.  
   (4)  Whenever a source -of-repair decision results in a plan to award a contract 
for the performance of maintenance and sustainment services on a major weapon system, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with statutory requirements, the acquisit ion plan must prescribe that award will be made on a competitive basis 
after giving full consideration to all sources (including sources that partner or subcontract with public or private sector repair activities).  
   (5)  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4328, acquisition plans for engineering 
manufacturing and development and production of major systems defined in  
10 U.S.C. 3041(a)  and 4202 and for major defense acquisition programs, must  
include performance measures that a re developed using best practices for 
responding to the positive or negative performance of a contractor for the engineering and manufacturing development or production of a weapon system, including embedded software.  At a minimum the contracting officer must — 
    (i)  Encourage the use of incentive fees and  penalties as appropriate; and  
    (ii)  Allow the program manager or comparable requiring activity official 
exercising program management responsibilities, to base determinations of a contractor’s performance on reliability and maintainability data collected during the program.  Such da ta collection and associated evaluation metrics must  be described in 
detail in the contract; and to the maximum extent practicable, the data must  be shared 
with appropriate contractor and Government organizations.  
  (g)  In accordance with section 815 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2009 (Pub. L. 110- 417) and DoD policy requirements, acquisition plans for 
major weapons systems must  include a plan for the preservation and storage of special 
tooling associated with the production of hardware for major defense acquisition programs through the end of the service life of the related weapons system.  The plan must  include the identification of any contract clauses, facilities, and funding required 
for the preservation and storage of such tooling.  The Under  Secretary of Defense for 
Acquisition  and Sustainment  (USD(A&amp;S )) may waive this requirement if USD( A&amp;S ) 
determines that it is in the best interest of DoD.  
  (h)  When selecting contract type, see 234.004
 (section 811 of the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (Pub. L. 112- 239)).</pre>
