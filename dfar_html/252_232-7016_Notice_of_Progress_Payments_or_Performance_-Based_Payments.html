    <h1>252.232-7016 Notice of Progress Payments or Performance -Based Payments</h1>
    <pre>As prescribed in  232.1005- 70(c), insert the following provision:  
  
NOTICE OF PROGRESS PAYMENTS OR PERFORMANCE- BASED PAYMENTS 
(APR 2020)  
  
      (a)  The need for customary progress payments in accordance with subpart 32.5 of 
the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or performance- based payments in 
accordance with FAR subpart 32.10 will not be considered as a handicap or adverse 
factor in the  award of the contract.  
  
      (b)  This solicitation includes a FAR and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation 
Supplement (DFARS) clause for performance -based payments and a FAR clause for 
progress payments. The resultant contract will include either performance -based 
payments or progress payments, not both, except as may be authorized on separate 
orders subject to FAR 32.1003(c).  
  
              (1)   The performance -based payments clauses will be included in the contract 
if— 
  
                    (i)  The Offeror has provided positive representation in response to 
DFARS  252.232- 7015, Performance -Based Payments —Representation;  
  
                    (ii)  The Offeror proposes a performance -based payment arrangement in 
accordance with FAR 52.232- 28, Invitation to Propose Performance- Based Payments, 
including proposed events and timing, event completion criteria, event values, and expected expenditure profile; and  
  
                    (iii)  The Offeror and the Government reach agreement on all aspects of the 
arrangement.  
  
              (2)   If performance -based payments clauses are not included in the resultant 
contract, the progress payments clause included in this solicitation will be included in any resultant contract, modified or altered if necessary in accordance with FAR 52.232 -
16 and its Alternate I. Even though the progress payme nts clause is included in the 
contract, the clause shall be inoperative during any time the contractor’s accounting system and controls are determined by the Government to be inadequate for segregation and accumulation of contract costs.
