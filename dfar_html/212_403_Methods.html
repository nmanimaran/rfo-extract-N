    <h1>212.403 Methods</h1>
    <pre>(a)(1)   The Governmentwide commercial purchase card . 
    (i)  Follow the procedures at PGI 21 2.403
(a)(1) (i)(A) for authorizing, 
establishing, and operating a Governmentwide commercial purchase card program.  
    (ii)  “United States,” as used in this section, means the 50 States and the 
District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, Wake Island, Johnston Island, Canton Island, the outer Continental Shelf, and any other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States (but not including leased bases).  
    (iii)  Use the Governmentwide commercial purchase card as the method of 
purchase and/or method of payment for purchases valued at or below the micro -
purchase threshold.  This policy applies to all types of contract actions authorized by the FAR unless — 
     (A )  The Deputy Secretary of Defense has approved an exception for an 
electronic commerce/electronic data interchange system or operational requirement that results in a more cost- effective payment process;  
     (B )(1)  A general or flag officer or a member of the Senior Executive 
Service (SES) makes a written determination that—       ( i)  The source or sources available for the supply or service do not 
accept the purchase card; and  
      ( ii)  The contracting office is seeking a source that accepts the 
purchase card.  
     ( 2)  To prevent mission delays, if an activity does not have a resident 
general or flag officer or SES member, delegation of this authority to the level of the senior local commander or director is permitted; or  
     (C)  The purchase or payment meets one or more of the following 
criteria:  
      ( 1)  The place of performance is entirely outside the United States 
and its outlying areas.  
      ( 2)  The purchase is a Standard Form 44 purchase for aviation fuel 
or oil.  
      ( 3)  The purchase is an overseas transaction by a contracting officer 
in support of a contingency operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13) or a humanitarian or peacekeeping operation as defined in 10 U.S.C. 3015(2).  
      ( 4)  The purchase is a transaction in support of intelligence or other 
specialized activities addressed by Part 2.7 of Executive Order 12333.  
 12 
      ( 5)  The purchase is for training exercises in preparation for 
overseas contingency, humanitarian, or peacekeeping operations.  
 
     ( 6)  The payment is made with an accommodation check.  
      ( 7)  The payment is for a transportation bill.  
      ( 8)  The purchase is under a Federal Supply Schedule contract that 
does not permit use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card.  
      ( 9)  The purchase is for medical services and — 
       ( i)  It involves a controlled substance or narcotic;  
       ( ii)  It requires the submission of a Health Care Summary 
Record to document the nature of the care purchased;  
       ( iii)  The ultimate price of the medical care is subject to an 
independent determination that changes the price paid based on application of a mandatory CHAMPUS Maximum Allowable Charge determination that reduces the Government liability below billed charges;  
       ( iv)  The Government already has entered into a contract to pay 
for the services without the use of a purchase card;  
       ( v)  The purchaser is a beneficiary seeking medical care; or  
       ( vi)  The senior local commander or director of a hospital or 
laboratory determines that use of the purchase card is not appropriate or cost- effective.  
The Medical Prime Vendor Program and the DoD Medical Electronic Catalog Program are two examples where use of the purchase card may not be cost -effective.  
    (iv)  An individual appointed in accordance with 201.403-2
(a)(1) also may 
use the Governmentwide commercial purchase card to make a purchase that exceeds the micro -purchase threshold but does not exceed $25,000, if — 
     (A)  The purchase — 
      ( 1)  Is made outside the United States for use outside the United
