    (A)  The original manufacturers of the parts;  
     (B)  Their authorized suppliers; or  
 
    (C)  Suppliers that obtain such parts exclusively from the original

   (ii)  Obtain electronic parts that are not in production by the original 
manufacturer or an authorized aftermarket manufacturer, and that are not currently available in stock from a source listed in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, from suppliers identified  by the Contractor as contractor- approved suppliers, 
provided that— 
 
    (A)  For identifying and approving such contractor- approved 
suppliers, the contractor uses established counterfeit prevention industry standards and processes (including inspection, testing, and authentication), such as the DoD -
adopted standards at https://assist.dla.mil
; 
 
    (B)  The contractor assumes responsibility for the authenticity of 
parts provided by such contractor- approved suppliers (see  231.205- 71); and  
 
    (C)  The selection of such contractor -approved suppliers is subject to 
review, audit, and approval by the Government, generally in conjunction with a contractor purchasing system review or other surveillance of purchasing practices by the contract administratio n office, or if the Government obtains credible evidence 
that a contractor– approved supplier has provided counterfeit parts .  The contractor 
 46 
 may proceed with the acquisition of electronic parts from a contractor- approved 
supplier unless otherwise notified by DoD.  
 
  (2)  The Government requires contractors and subcontractors to comply with 
the notification, inspection, testing, and authentication requirements of paragraph 
(b)(3)(ii) of the clause at  252.246- 7008 , Sources of Electronic Parts, if the

    (B)  A subcontractor (other than the original manufacturer) that 
refuses to accept flowdown of this clause; or  
 
   (ii)  Cannot confirm that an electronic part is new or not previously used 
and that it has not been comingled in supplier new production or stock with used, refurbished, reclaimed, or returned parts.  
 
  (3)  Contractors and subcontractors are still required to comply with the

   (i)  Authorized to purchase electronic parts from the Federal Supply 
Schedule; 
 
   (ii)  Purchasing electronic parts from suppliers accredited by the Defense 
Microelectronics Activity; or  
 
   (iii)  Requisitioning electronic parts from Government inventory/stock 
under the authority of the clause at  252.251- 7000

    (A)  The cost of any required inspection, testing, and authentication 
of such parts may be charged as a direct cost.  
 
    (B)  The Government is responsible for the authenticity of the

     ( 1)  Promptly replace such part at no charge; and  
 
     ( 2)  Consider an adjustment in the contract schedule to the

purchasing system by the contracting officer and/or withholding of payments (see 252.244- 7001
 , Contractor Purchasing System Administration).  
 
  (2)  System  criteria.  A counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance
