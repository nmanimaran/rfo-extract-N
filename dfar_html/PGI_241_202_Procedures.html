    <pre>(1)  Connection and service charges.  The Government may pay a connection 
charge when required to cover the cost of the necessary connecting facilities.  A connection 
charge based on the estimated labor cost of installing and removing the facility must not include salvage cost.  A lump- sum connection charge must be no more than the agreed cost 
of the connecting facilities less net salvage.  The order of precedence for contractual treatment of connection and service charges is — 
    (i)  No connection charge.  
    (ii)  Termination liability.  Use when an obligation is necessary to secure the 
required services.  The obligation must be not more than the agreed connection charge, less

 any net salvage material costs.   Use of a termination liability instead of a connection charge 
requires the approval of the service power procurement officer or designee.  
    (iii)  Connection charge, refundable.  Use a refundable connection charge when 
the supplier refuses to provide the facilities based on lack of capital or published rules which prohibit providing up- front funding.  The contract should provide for refund of the connection 
charge within five years unless a longer period or omission of the refund requirement is authorized by the service power procurement officer or designee.  
    (iv)  Connection and service charges, nonrefundable.  The Government may 
pay certain nonrefundable, nonrecurring charges including service initiation charges, a contribution in aid of construction, membership fees, and charges required by the supplier&#x27;s rules and regulations to be paid by the customer.  If possible, consider sharing with other 
than Government users the use of (and costs for) facilities when large nonrefundable charges are required.  
 
 (2)(A) Do not use the connection charge provisions for the installation of Government -
owned distribution lines and facilities. The acquisition of such facilities must be authorized by legislation and accomplished in accordance with FAR Part 36. Also, do not use the connection charge provisions for the installation of new facilities related to the supplier&#x27;s production and general “backbone” system unless authorized by legislation.  
   (B) Construction labor standards ordinarily do not apply to construction 
accomplished under the connection charge provisions of this part. However, if installation includes construction of a public building or public work per FAR 36.102, construction labor 
standards may apply.</pre>
