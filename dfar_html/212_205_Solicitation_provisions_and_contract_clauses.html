    <pre>See DoD Class Deviation 2023- O0008
, Commercial Products and Commercial Services 
Omnibus Clause for Acquisitions Using the Procurement Desktop -Defense System, 
issued September 18, 2023.  This class deviation allows the contracting officer to use the 
PD2 clause logic capability to automatically select the clauses that are applicable to the 
specific solicitation and contract.  The contracting officer must  ensure that the deviation 
clause is incorporated into these solicitations and contracts because the deviation clause fulfills the statutory requirements on auditing and subcontract claus es applicable to 
commercial products and commercial services .  The deviation also authorizes 
adjustments to the deviation clause required by future changes to the clause at FAR 
52.212- 5 that are published in the FAR.   This deviation is effective for 3 years, or until 
otherwise rescinded.
