authority of 10 U.S.C. 1091 using  the procedures in this section.  These procedures do 
not apply to contracts awarded to business entities other than individuals.  Selections made using the procedures in this section are exempt by statute from FAR Part 6 competition requirements.  
   (3)  Approval requirements for — 
     (i) Direct health care personal services contracts (see paragraphs (b)(1)(i)
