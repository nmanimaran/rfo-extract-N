    <h1>236.101-70 Prequalification of sources</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Prequalification procedures may be used when necessary to ensure timely and 
efficient performance of critical construction projects. Prequalification — 
   (1)  Results in a list of sources determined to be qualified to perform a specific 
construction contract; and    (2)  Limits offerors to those with proven competence to perform in the required 
manner.  
 36 
  (b)  The head of the contracting activity must— 
 
  (1)  Authorize the use of prequalification by determining, in writing, that a 
construction project is of an urgency or complexity that requires prequalification; and  
   (2)  Approve the prequalification procedures.  
  (c)  For small businesses, the prequalification procedures must require the 
qualifying authority to — 
   (1) Request a preliminary recommendation from the appropriate Small Business 
Administration regional office if the qualifying authority believes a small business is not responsible;  
   (2) Permit the small business to submit a bid or proposal if the preliminary 
recommendation is that the small business is responsible; and  
   (3) Follow the procedures in FAR 19.6 if the small business is in line for award 
and is found nonresponsible.</pre>
