    <h1>PGI 201.170-3 Administration of peer r eviews</h1>
    <pre>(a)  The results and recomm endations that are products of peer r eviews are intended to 
be advisory in nature;  however, in the event the peer r eview report includes a 
recommendation that is identified as “significant” and the contracting officer does not intend 
to follow that recommendation, the senior procurement official of the contracting activity for the reviewed organization must be made aware of this fact before action is taken (or inaction, as applicable) that is contrary to the recommendation.  Reviews will be conducted 
in a manner that preserves the authority, judgment, and discretion of the contracting officer and the senior officials of the requiring activity.  
  (b)  Peer review teams should be comprised of senior contracting officials and attorneys  
as appropriate.   Teams may include civilian employees or military personnel external to the 
department, agency, or component that is the subject of the p eer review.

conducted at the location of the executing contracting organization when appropriate.  
  (d)  See paragraph (g) of this section for a  list of the documents that must be made 
available to the competitive peer review team, along with the specific elements the team will
