   (1)  Ordinarily, a representative of the contract administration office signs or 
stamps the shipping papers that accompany Government source -inspected supplies 
to release them for shipment .  This is done for both prime and subcontracts.  
 
  (2)  An alternative procedure (see paragraph (b) of this section) permits the 
contractor to assume the responsibility for releasing the supplies for shipment.  
 
  (3)  The alternative procedure may include prime contractor release of 
supplies inspected at a subcontractor&#x27;s facility.  
 
  (4)  The use of the alternative procedure releases DoD manpower to perform 
technical functions by eliminating routine signing or stamping of the papers 
accompanying each shipment.

the contract administration office interferes with the operation of the Government contract quality assurance program or takes too much of the Government representative&#x27;s time;  
 
   (ii)  There is sufficient continuity of production to permit the Government 
to establish a systematic and continuing evaluation of the contractor&#x27;s control of quality; and  
 
   (iii)  The contractor has a record of satisfactory quality, including that 
pertaining to preparation for shipment.  
 
  (3)  The contract administration office must  withdraw, in writing, the 
authorization when there is an indication that the conditions in paragraph (b)(2) of this section no longer exist.  
 
  (4)  When the alternative procedure is used, require the contractor to —

or copies of the shipping paper(s), or on an attachment— 
 
    The supplies in this shipment —
