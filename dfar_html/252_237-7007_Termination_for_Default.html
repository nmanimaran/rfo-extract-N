    <h1>252.237-7007 Termination for Default</h1>
    <pre>As prescribed in 237.7003(a) and (a)(5), insert  the following clause:  
 
TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT ( DEC 1991)  
  (a)  This clause supplements and is in addition to the Default clause of this contract.  
  (b)  The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for default by written notice 
without the ten-day notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of the Default clause if — 
   (1)  The Contractor, through circumstances reasonably within its control or that 
of its employees, performs any act under or in connection with this contract, or fails in 
the performance of any service under this contract and the act or failures may reason ably be considered to reflect discredit upon the Department of Defense in 
fulfilling its responsibility for proper care of remains;  
   (2)  The Contractor, or its employees, solicits relatives or friends of the deceased 
to purchase supplies or services not under this contract.  (The Contractor may furnish 
supplies or arrange for services not under this contract, only if representatives of the deceased voluntarily request, select, and pay for them.);  
   (3)  The services or any part of the services are performed by anyone other than 
the Contractor or the Contractor&#x27;s employees without the written authorization of the Contracting Officer;  
   (4)  The Contractor refuses to perform the services required for any particular 
remains; or  
   (5)  The Contractor mentions or otherwise uses this contract in its advertising in 
any way.
