    <h1>212.001-70 Applicability</h1>
    <pre>(a)  FAR part 12 procedures.  Use of FAR part 12 procedures is based on  applicability 
of one of the following statutes that provide for treatment as a commercial product or commercial service  and use of FAR part 12 procedures, even though the item may not 
meet the definition of “commercial product” or “commercial service” at FAR 2.101 and does not require a commercial product or commercial service  determination:  
   (1 )  41 U.S.C. 1903 – Supplies or services to be used to facilitate defense against 
or recovery from cyber, nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack pursuant to FAR 12. 001(b). 
   (2 )  10 U.S.C. 3457 – Supplies or services from nontraditional defense 
contractors pursuant to  paragraph (d) of this section.  
   (3 )  10 U.S.C. 3458 – Supplies or services resulting from a commercial solutions 
opening pursuant to subpart 212.70
. 
  (b )  Prior commercial product or commercial service determinations . 
   (1 )  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3456(c) , except as provided in paragraph ( b)(2)(i) of 
this section or unless the item was acquired pursuant to paragraph ( a) of this section, if 
the Commercial Item Database (for website see PGI 212. 001
-70(b)(A)(1 ) contains a prior 
commerciality determination, or the contracting officer has other evidence that an item has previously been acquired by DoD using commercial product and commercial service  
acquisition procedures under FAR part 12, then the prior contract must  serve as a prior 
determination that an item is a commercial product or commercial service .  The 
contracting officer must  document the file accordingly.  
   (2)(i)  If the item to be acquired meets the criteria in paragraph ( b)(1) of this 
section, the item may not be acquired using other than FAR part 12 procedures unless the head of the contracting activity issues a determination as specified in paragraph ( b)(2)(ii)(B ) of this section.  
    ( ii)  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 3703(d )(1), the contracting officer may presume 
that a prior commercial product or commercial service  determination made by a DoD 
department, agency, or component serve s as a determination for subsequent 
procurements of such item.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3703( d) and 10 U.S.C. 
3456(c), if the contracting officer questions a prior determination to use FAR part 12 procedures and instead chooses to proceed with a procurement of an item previously determined to be a commercial product or commercial service  using procedures other 
than FAR part 12 procedures, the contracting officer must  request a review by the head 
of the contracting activity that will cond uct the procurement.  Not later than 30 days 
after receiving a request for review, the head of the contracting activity will—      (A )  Confirm that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures was 
appropriate and still applicable; or  
 12 
    (B )  Issue a determination that the prior use of FAR part 12 procedures 
was improper or that it is no longer appropriate to acquire the item using FAR part 12 procedures, with a written explanation of the basis for the determination.  
  (c)  Commercial product or commercial service determination .  Unless the procedures 
in paragraph ( b) of this section are applicable, when using FAR part 12 procedures for 
acquisitions of commercial products and commercial services  that exceed the simplified 
acquisition  threshold , the contracting officer must — 
   (1 )  Determine in writing that the acquisition meets the “commercial product” or 
“commercial service” definition in FAR 2.101;  
   (2 )  Include the written determination in the contract file ; 
   (3 )  Obtain approval at one level above the contracting officer when a 
commercial product or commercial service  determination relies on paragraphs (1)(ii), 
(3), or (4) of the “commercial product” definition at FAR 2.101 or paragraph (2) of the “commercial service” definition at FAR 2.101; and  
   (4 )  Follow the procedures and guidance at PGI 212. 001
-70(b) regarding file 
documentation and commercial product or commercial service  determinations . 
  (d )  Nontraditional defense contractors.   In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3457, 
contracting officers — 
   (1 )  Except  as provided in paragraph ( d)(2) of this section, may treat supplies 
and services provided by nontraditional defense contractors as commercial products or commercial services  (see PGI 212.001- 70(d)(1)); 
   (2 )  Will  treat services provided by a business unit that is a nontraditional 
defense contractor as commercial services , to the extent that such services use the same  
pool of employees as used for commercial customers and are priced using methodology similar to methodology used for commercial pricing; and  
   (3 )  Will  document the file when treating supplies or services from a 
nontraditional defense contractor as commercial products or commercial services  in 
accordance with paragraph (d )(1) or (2) of this section.
