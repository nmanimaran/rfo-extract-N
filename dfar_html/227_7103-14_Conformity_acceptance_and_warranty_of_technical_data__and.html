    <h1>227.7103-14 Conformity, acceptance, and warranty of technical data  and</h1>
    <pre>computer software . 
 
 (a) [Reserved]    
 
 (b)  Conformity and acceptance.   (1)  Solicitations and contracts requiring the 
delivery of technical data , including  computer software documentation , must  specify the 
requirements that the data must satisfy to be acceptable.  Contracting officers, or their 
authorized representatives, are responsible for determining whether technical data tendered for acceptance conform to the contractual requirements.  
   (2)  The clause at 252.227- 7996 , Technical Data —Withholding of Payment, 
provides for withholding up to 10 percent of the contract price pending either correction 
or replacement of the nonconforming technical data , or negotiation of an equitable 
reduction in contract price.  The amount subject to withholding may be expressed as a 
fixed dollar amount or as a percentage of the contract price.  In either case, consider the 
relative value and importance of the data when determining the amount.   
   (3)  Do not accept technical data that do not conform to the contractual 
requirements in all respects.  Except for nonconforming restrictive markings (see 
paragraph (b)(4) of this section), require correction or replacement of nonconforming 
data (or an equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the 
nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government ’s interests)  in 
accordance with — 
    (i)  The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and 
acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or  
 
   (ii)  The procedures at FAR 46.407(c) through (g), if the contract does not 
contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.  
   (4)  Follow the procedures at 227.7103 -12(a)(2) if nonconforming markings are 
the sole reason technical data fail to conform to contractual requirements.  The 
contracting officer may withhold an amount for payment, consistent with the terms of 
the clause  at 252.227- 7996 , pending correction of the nonconforming markings.  
   (5)(i)  Specify, in s olicitations and contracts requiring the delivery of computer 
software , requirements the software must satisfy to be acceptable under the contract .  
    (ii)  Contracting officers, or their authorized representatives, are responsible 
for determining whether computer software tendered for acceptance conforms to the contractual requirements.  
    (iii)  Except for nonconforming restrictive markings, do not accept software 
that does not conform in all respects to applicable contractual requirements.  However, follow the procedures at 227.7103 -12(a) if nonconforming markings are the sole reason 
computer sof tware tendered for acceptance fails to conform to contractual requirements.   
    
   (iv)  Require  correction or replacement of nonconforming software (or an 
equitable reduction in contract price when correction or replacement of the 
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
   nonconforming data is not practicable or is not in the Government’s interests) in 
accordance with — 
     (A)  The provisions of a contract clause providing for inspection and 
acceptance of deliverables and remedies for nonconforming deliverables; or  
     (B)  The procedures at FAR part 46.407(c) through (g), i f the contract 
does not contain an inspection clause providing remedies for nonconforming deliverables.  
  (c)  Warranty .  (1)  Consider the  intended use of the technical data (including repair 
and maintenance) and the costs to obtain the warranty before deciding to obtain a data 
warranty (see FAR  part 46).   
   (2)  As prescribed in 246.710, insert  the clause at 252.246- 7001, Warranty of 
Data, and its alternates, or a substantially similar clause when the Government needs a specific warranty of technical data.  
   (3)  Warranties for Computer Software.   (i)  Weapon systems.   Computer software 
that is a component of a weapon system or major subsystem should be warranted as part of the weapon system warranty.  Follow the procedures at 246.7.  
    (ii)  Non-weapon systems.   The contracting office r must approve use of a 
computer software warranty other than a weapon system warranty.  Consider the 
factors at FAR 46.703 when deciding whether to obtain a computer software warranty.  
When approval for a warranty is obtained, modify the clause at 252.246- 7001, Warranty 
of Data, and its alternates, as necessary for use with computer software.</pre>
