 (3)  Interchangeability; and 
 (4)  Maintainability;  
 
(C)  Problems encountered in the development of the material;  
 (D)  Problems encountered in other procurements of the same or similar 
material;  
 (E)  Available feedback data from contract administration, receiving, 
testing, or using activities; and 
 (F)  The experience of other contractors in overcoming manufacturing 
problems.  
 
(ii)  The instructions must — 
 
(A)  Be kept to a minimum;  
 (B)  Ensure that the activities requested are in direct relation to contract 
quality requirements to serve as objective evidence of quality conformance; and

(iii)  The instructions must  not— 
 
(A)  Serve as a substitute for incomplete contract quality requirements;  
 (B)  Impose greater inspection requirements than are in the contract;

(2)  All characteristics; or  
 (3)  All characteristics in the classification of defects;  
 
(D)  Be used for routine administrative procedures; or  
 (E)  Specify continued inspection requirements when statistically sound 
sampling will provide an adequate degree of protection.  
 
(iv)  After issuing the instructions, the technical activity must — 
 
(A)  Provide the contract administration office with available information 
regarding those factors that resulted in the requirement for Government inspection;  
 (B)  Periodically analyze the need to continue, change, or discontinue the
