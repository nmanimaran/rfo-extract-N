determine whether  acceptable terms  exist  for transferring such rights.  Any resulting 
license agreement, made part of the contract, must list or describe all technical data for which the contractor has granted the Government additional rights, and specify the additional rights granted  227.7208- 3  Government right to review, verify, challenge, and validate 
asserted restrictions.  
Follow the procedures at 227.7103 -13 regarding the validation of asserted restrictions 
on technical data related to commercial products or commercial services.</pre>
