    <h1>PGI 229.7002-2 Import duty</h1>
    <pre>The United States shall not pay a contract import dut y and contract prices must be exclusive  
of duty, except when the administrative cost compared to the low dollar value of a contract makes it impracticable to obtain relief from contract import duty.  In this instance, the 
contracting officer must document the contract file with a statement that  
 
 (a)  The administrative burden of securing tax relief under the contract was out of 
proportion to the tax relief involved;  
  (b)  It is impracticable to secure tax relief;  
  (c)  Tax relief is therefore not being secured; and 
  (d)  The acquisition does not involve the expenditure of any funds to establish a 
permanent military installation.</pre>
