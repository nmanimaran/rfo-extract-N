    <h1>217.670 Procedures</h1>
    <pre>Departments and agencies must  establish and maintain procedures for reviewing and 
approving orders placed for supplies and services under non -DoD contracts, whether 
through direct acquisition or assisted acquisition, when the amount of the order exceeds the simplified acquisition thres hold.  These procedures must  include—  
  (a)  Evaluating whether using a non- DoD contract for the acquisition is in the best 
interest of DoD.  Factors to be considered include — 
   (1)  Satisfying customer requirements;  
   (2)  Schedule;  
   (3)  Cost effectiveness (taking into account discounts and fees).  In order to 
ensure awareness of the total cost of fees associated with use of a non -DoD contract, 
follow the procedures at PGI 217.670(a)(3) ; and  
   (4)  Contract administration (including oversight);  
  (b)  Determining that the tasks to be accomplished or supplies to be provided are 
within the scope of the contract to be used;  
  (c)  Reviewing funding to ensure that it is used in accordance with appropriation 
limitations; and
