    <h1>PGI 226.7202-2 Postaward</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Contracts awarded to eligible contractors under this Demonstration Project are  counted 
toward DoD’s small disadvantaged business goal.   The contractor must be an eligible 
contractor when options under the contract are exercised, in order for DoD to continue to receive credit for the contract toward its small disadvantaged business goal.  
 (b)  Contracting officers may exercise the option if the contractor has represented that it is 
not an eligible contractor; however, the contract will not  count toward DoD’s small 
disadvantaged business goal.</pre>
