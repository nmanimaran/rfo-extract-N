    <h1>243.371 Certification of requests for equitable adjustment</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Do not pay a  request for equitable adjustment to contract terms that exceeds 
the simplified acquisition threshold unless the contractor certifies the request in accordance with the clause at  252.243- 7002
. 
  (b)  To determine if the dollar threshold for requiring certification is met, add 
together the absolute value of each cost increase and each cost decrease.  See PGI 
243.371 for  an example.  
  (c)  The certification required by 10 U.S.C. 3862(a), as implemented in the clause 
at 252.243- 7002
 , is different from the certification required by 41 U.S.C. 7103, 
Disputes. If the contractor has certified a request for equitable adjustment in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3862(a), and desires to convert the request to a claim under the Contract Disputes statute, the contractor must  certify the claim in 
accordance with FAR subpart 33.2.</pre>
