 Actual nonrecoverable costs means the installed costs of the facilities and 
equipment, less cost of reusable materials, and less net salvage value.  
 
 Basic cancellation liability  means the actual nonrecoverable cost, which the 
Government shall reimburse the Contractor at the time services are cancelled.  
 
 Basic termination liability  means the nonrecoverable cost amortized in equal 
monthly increments throughout the liability period.  
  Installed costs means the actual cost of equipment and materials specifically 
provided or used, plus the actual cost of installing (including engineering, labor, supervision, transportation, rights -of-way, and any other items which are 
chargeable to the capital accounts of the Contractor), less any costs the government may have directly reimbursed the Contractor under the Special Construction and Equipment Charges clause of this agreement/contract.  
  Net salvage value  means the salvage value less the cost of removal.  
  (b)  If the Government cancels any of the services ordered under this 
agreement/contract, before the services are made available to the Government, or terminates any of these services after they are made available to the Government, the Government will reimburs e the Contractor for the actual nonrecoverable costs 
the Contractor has reasonably incurred in providing facilities and equipment for which the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse .  The Government will not reimburse 
the Contractor for any actual nonr ecoverable costs incurred after notice of award, 
but prior to execution of the order.  
  (c)  When feasible, the Contractor shall reuse cancelled or terminated facilities or 
equipment to minimize the charges to the Government.  
  (d)  If at any time the Government requires that telecommunications facilities or 
equipment be relocated within the Contractor&#x27;s service area, the Government will have the option of paying the costs of relocating the facilities or equipment in lieu of paying a ny termination or cancellation charge under this clause .  The basic 
cancellation liability or basic termination liability applicable to the facilities or equipment in their former location shall continue to apply to the facilities and equipment in their new location .  Monthly recurring charges shall continue to be 
paid during the period.  
  (e)  When there is another requirement or foreseeable reuse in place of cancelled 
or terminated facilities or equipment, no charge shall apply and the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability shall be appropriately reduced .  
When feasible, the Contractor shall promptly reuse discontinued channels or facilities, including equipment for which the Government is obligated to pay a minimum service charge.  
  (f)  The amount of the Government&#x27;s liability upon cancellation or termination of 
any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract will be determined under applicable tariffs governing cancellation and termination charges which —

  (1)  Are filed by the Contractor with a governmental regulatory body, as 
defined in the Orders For Facilities and Services clause of this agreement/contract;  
 
  (2)  Are in effect on the date of termination; and  
 
  (3)  Provide specific cancellation or termination charges for the facilities and 
equipment involved or show how to determine the charges.  
  (g)  The amount of the Government&#x27;s liability upon cancellation or termination of 
any of the services ordered under this agreement/contract, which are not subject to a governmental regulatory body, will be determined under a mutually agreed schedule in the com munication services authorization (CSA) or other contractual 
document.  
  (h)  If no applicable tariffs are in effect on the date of cancellation or termination 
or set forth in the applicable CSA or other contractual document, the Government&#x27;s liability will be determined under the following settlement procedures — 
   (1)  The Contractor agrees to provide the Contracting Officer, in such 
reasonable detail as the Contracting Officer may require, inventory schedules covering all items of property or facilities in the Contractor&#x27;s possession, the cost of which is included in th e Basic Cancellation or Termination Liability for which the 
Contractor has no foreseeable reuse.  
   (2)  The Contractor shall use its best efforts to sell property or facilities when 
the Contractor has no foreseeable reuse or when the Government has not exercised its option to take title under the Title to Telecommunications Facilities and Equipment clause of  this agreement/contract.  The Contractor shall apply any 
proceeds of the sale to reduce any payments by the Government to the Contractor under a cancellation or termination settlement.  
  (3)  The Contractor shall record actual nonrecoverable costs under established 
accounting procedures prescribed by the cognizant governmental regulatory authority or, if no such procedures have been prescribed, under generally accepted accounting procedures applicable to the provision of telecommunication services for public use.  
  
 (4)  The net salvage value shall be deducted from the Contractor&#x27;s installed cost .  
In determining net salvage value, the Contractor shall consider the foreseeable reuse of the facilities and equipment by the Contractor.  The Contractor shall make 
allowance for the cost of dismantling, removal, reconditioning, and disposal of the facilities and equipment when necessary either for the sale of facilities or their reuse by the Contractor in another location.  
  (5)  Upon termination of services, the Government will reimburse the Contractor 
for the nonrecoverable cost less such costs amortized to the date services are terminated and establish the liability period as mutually agreed to but not to exceed ten years .  In the case of either a cancellation or a termination, the Government&#x27;s 
presumed maximum liability will be capped by the unpaid non -recurring charges

 and the monthly recurring charges set out in the contract/agreement.  The 
presumed maximum liability for monthly recurring charges shall be capped at 
monthly recurring charges for the minimum service period and any required notice period.  
  (6)  When the basic cancellation liability or basic termination liability 
established by the CSA or other contractual document is based on estimated costs, the Contractor agrees to settle on the basis of actual cost at the time of cancellation or termination.  
  (7)  The Contractor agrees that, if after settlement but within the termination 
liability period of the services, should the Contractor make reuse of equipment or facilities which were treated as nonreusable or nonsalvable in the settlement, the Contractor shal l reimburse the Government for the value of the equipment or 
facilities.  
  (8)  The Contractor agrees to exclude — 
   (i)  Any costs which are not included in determining cancellation and 
termination charges under the Contractor&#x27;s standard practices or procedures; and    (ii)  Charges not ordinarily made by the Contractor for similar facilities or 
equipment, furnished under similar circumstances.  
   (i)  The Government may, under such terms and conditions as it may 
prescribe, make partial payments and payments on account against costs incurred by the Contractor in connection with the cancelled or terminated portion of this agreement/contract .  The Government may make these payments if the Contracting 
Officer determines that the total of the payments is within the amount the 
Contractor is entitled .  If the total of the payments is in excess of the amount finally 
agreed or determined to be due under th is clause, the Contractor shall pay the 
excess to the Government upon demand.  
  (j)  Failure to agree shall be a dispute concerning a question of fact within the 
meaning of the Disputes clause.
