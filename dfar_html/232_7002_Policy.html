of payment requests and receiving reports could compromise the safeguarding of 
classified information or national security;

   (3 )  Cases in which DoD is unable to receive payment requests or provide  
acceptance in electronic form;  
   (4 )  Cases in which the contractor has requested permission in writing to submit 
payment requests and receiving reports by nonelectronic means, and the contracting officer has provided instructions for a temporary alternative method of submission of payment requests and receiving reports in the contract administration data section of 
the contract or task or delivery order (e.g., section G, an addendum to FAR 52.212 -4, or 
applicable clause); and  
   (5 )  When the Governmentwide commercial purchase card is used as the method 
of payment, in which case only submission of the receiving report in electronic form is 
required.  
  (b)(1)  The only acceptable electronic form for submission of payment requests and 
receiving reports is Wide Area WorkFlow (WAWF) ( https://wawf.eb.mil/

follows:  
    (i)  For payment of commercial transportation services provided under a 
Government rate tender, contract, or task or delivery order for transportation services, the use of a DoD -approved electronic third party payment system or other exempted 
vendor payment/invoicing system (e.g., PowerTrack, Transportation Financial Management System, and Cargo and Billing System) is permitted.  
    (ii)  For submitting and processing payment requests and receiving reports 
for contracts or task or delivery orders for rendered health care services, the use of TRICARE Encounter Data System as the electronic form is permitted.
