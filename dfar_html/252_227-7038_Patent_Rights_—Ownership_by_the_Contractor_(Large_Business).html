pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with 37

    (i)  Disclose, in writing, each subject invention to the Contracting Officer 
within 2 months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Contractor personnel responsible for patent matters, or within 6 months after the Contractor first becomes aware that a su bject invention has been made, whichever is earlier;  
    (ii)  Include in the disclosure — 
     (A)  The inventor(s) and the contract under which the invention was 
made;  
     (B)  Sufficient technical detail to convey a clear understanding of the 
invention; and  
     (C)  Any publication, on sale (i.e., sale or offer for sale), or public use of

any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer at the time of disclosure or 
within 8 months of disclosure, as to those countries (including the United States) in 
which the Contractor will retain ownership.  However, in any case where publication, 
on sale, or public use has initiated the 1 -year statutory period during which valid patent 
protection can be obtained in the United States, the agency may shorten the per iod of 
election of title to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.  
   (3)  The Contractor shall — 
    (i)  File either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application on an

offices within either 10 months of the first filed patent application (whether provisional or nonprovisional) or 6 months from the date the Commissioner of Patents grants permission t o file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a 
Secrecy Order.  
   (4)  The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, election, or 
filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause.  The Contracting Officer will 
normally grant the extension unless there is reason to believe the extension would 
prejudice the Government ’s interests.  
  (d)  Government ’s rights— (1)  Ownership.   The Contractor shall assign to the agency, 
upon written request, title to any subject invention — 
    (i)  If the Contractor elects not to retain title to a subject invention;

times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause and the agency requests title within 60 days after learning of the Contractor ’s failure to report or elect within the specified 
times;  
    (iii)  In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent 
applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, provided that, if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c)  of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, 
the Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country; and  
    (iv)  In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the 
prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.  
 2026 -O0036

identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters, so that the Contractor can comply with the disclosure provisions in paragraph (c) of this clause; and  
     (B)  Provide the disclosure in the Contractor’ s format, which should 
require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause;  
 
   (ii)  Instruct its employees, through employee agreements or other suitable 
educational programs, as to the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or statutory foreign bars; and     (iii)  Execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject 
inventions and to establish the Government ’s rights in the subject inventions.

requirement for an exclusive license agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its 
assignee that — 
   (1)  Reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on

invention in which it has retained ownership, the agency has the right to require licensing pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 203 and 210(c), 37 CFR 401.6, and any supplemental regulations of the agency in effect on the date of contract award.

the Government any rights with respect to any invention other than a subject invention.  
  (j)  Examination of records relating to inventions.   (1)  The Contracting Officer or any 
authorized representative shall, until 3 years after final payment under this contract, have the right to examine any books (including laboratory notebooks), records, and documents of the Contractor relating to the conception  or first reduction to practice of 
inventions in the same field of technology as the work under this contract to determine whether — 
    (i)  Any inventions are subject inventions;  
    (ii)  The Contractor has established procedures required by paragraph (e)(5) 
of this clause; and  
    (iii)  The Contractor and its inventors have complied with the procedures.  
   (2)  If the Contracting Officer learns of an unreported Contractor invention that 
the Contracting Officer believes may be a subject invention, the Contractor shall be required to disclose the invention to the agency for a determination of ownership rights.  
   (3)  Any examination of records under this paragraph (j) shall be subject to 
appropriate conditions to protect the confidentiality of the information involved.  
  (k)  Withholding of payment (this paragraph does not apply to subcontracts).   (1)  Any 
time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer may, in the Government ’s interest, withhold payment until a reserve not exceeding $50,000 or 5 
percent of the amount of the contract, whichever is less, is set aside if, in the Contracting Officer’ s opinion, the Contractor fails to—  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
   (i)  Establish, maintain, and follow effective procedures for identifying and 
disclosing subject inventions pursuant to paragraph (e)(5) of this clause;  
 
   (ii)  Disclose any subject invention pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this 
clause;  
 
   (iii)  Deliver acceptable interim reports pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(i) of 
this clause; or  
    (iv)  Provide the information regarding subcontracts pursuant to paragraph 
(e)(8) of this clause.  
   (2)  The reserve or balance shall be withheld until the Contracting Officer has 
determined that the Contractor has rectified whatever deficiencies exist and has delivered all reports, disclosures, and other information required by this clause.  
   (3)  The Government will not make final payment under this contract before the 
Contractor delivers to the Contracting Officer—  
    (i)  All disclosures of subject inventions required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
clause;  
    (ii)  An acceptable final report pursuant to paragraph (e)(7)(ii) of this clause; 
and 
    (iii)  All past due confirmatory instruments.  
   (4)  The Contracting Officer may decrease or increase the sums withheld up to 
the maximum authorized in paragraph (k)(1) of this clause.  No amount shall be 
withheld under this paragraph while the amount specified by this paragraph is being withheld under other provisions of the contract.  The withholding of any amount or the 
subsequent payment thereof shall not be construed as a waiver of any Government right.  
  (l)  Subcontracts.   (1)  The Contractor — 
    (i)  Shall include the substance of the Patent Rights -Ownership by the 
Contractor clause set forth at 52.227- 11 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), in 
all subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small busines s concern or nonprofit organization; and 
    (ii)  Shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (l), 
in all other subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work, unless a different patent rights clause is required by FAR 27.303.  
   (2)  For subcontracts at any tier—  
    (i)  The patents rights clause included in the subcontract shall retain all 
references to the Government and shall provide to the subcontractor all the rights and obligations provided to the Contractor in the clause.  The Contractor shall not, as

 27 
   consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor’ s subject 
inventions; and  
 
   (ii)  The Government, the Contractor, and the subcontractor agree that the 
mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Government with respect to those matters covered by this clause.  However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under 
the Contract Disputes statute in connection with proceedings under paragraph (h) of this clause.
