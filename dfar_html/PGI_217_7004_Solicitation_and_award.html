    <h1>PGI 217.7004 Solicitation and award</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Ensure s olicitations require offerors to state prices — 
   (1)  For the new items being acquired without any exchange; and  
   (2)  For the new items with the exchange (trade- in allowance) for the exchange 
property listed.  
  (b)  The contracting officer is not obligated to award on an exchange basis.  If the lowest 
evaluated offer is an offer for the new items without any exchange, the contracting officer may award on that basis and forgo the exchange.  
  (c)  Exchanges may be made only with the successful offeror.  When the successful offer 
includes an exchange, award one contract for both the acquisition of the new property and the trade -in of the exchange property.  The only exception is when the items must be 
acquired against a mandatory Federal supply schedule contract, in which case, award a separate contract for the exchange.
