    <h1>PGI 219.108-4 Evaluation, offering, and acceptance</h1>
    <pre>(1)  For requirements processed under the PA cited in DFARS 219.108- 1, the notification 
to the SBA shall clearly indicate that the requirement is being processed under the PA.  See 
DFARS 219.208- 3(a)(i i) for procedures related to purchase orders that do not exceed the 
simplified acquisition threshold.  All notifications should be submitted in writing and shall 
specify that — 
   (i)  Under the PA, an SBA acceptance or rejection of the offering is required within 5 
working days of receipt of the offering; and  
   (ii)(A)  For sole source requirements, an SBA acceptance shall include a size 
verification and a determination of the 8(a) firm’s program eligibility, and, upon acceptance, the contracting officer will solicit a proposal, conduct negotiations, and make award directly to the 8(a) firm; or  
     (B)  For competitive requirements, upon acceptance, the contracting officer 
will solicit offers, conduct source selection, and, upon receipt of an eligibility verification, award a contract directly to the selected 8(a) firm.  
  (2)  Under the PA cited in DFARS 219.108- 1, no separate agency offering or SBA 
acceptance is needed for requirements that are issued under purchase orders that do not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.  After an 8(a) contractor has been identifi ed, the 
contracting officer will establish the prices, terms, and conditions with the 8(a) contractor and prepare a purchase order, including the applicable clauses required by DFARS 219.108- 10.  
No later than the day that the purchase order is provided to  the 8(a) contractor, the 
contracting officer will provide to the cognizant SBA Business Opportunity Specialist via 
email  or any other means acceptable to the SBA district office — 
   (i)  A copy of the signed purchase order; and  
   (ii)  A notice stating that the purchase order is being processed under the PA.  The 
notice also shall indicate that the 8(a) contractor will be deemed eligible for award and will automatically begin work under the purchase order unless, within 2 working days after SBA’s 
receipt of the purchase order, the 8(a) contractor and the contracting officer are notified that the 8(a) contractor is ineligible for award.  
  (3)  The notification to SBA must  identify any joint venture proposed for performance of 
the contract.  SBA must  approve a joint venture before award of an 8(a) contract involving 
the joint venture.  
  (4)  For competitive requirements for construction to be performed overseas, submit the 
notification to SBA Headquarters.  
 
 (5)  For requirements processed under the PA cited in DFARS 219.108- 1, SBA’s 
acceptance is required within 5 working days (but see DFARS 219.208- 3(a)(i i) for 
procedures related to purchase orders that do not exceed the simplified acquisition 
threshold).</pre>
