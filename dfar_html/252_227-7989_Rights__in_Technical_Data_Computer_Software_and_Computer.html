 “Commercial computer software ” means software developed or regularly used for 
nongovernmental purposes which—  
   (1)  Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;  
   (2)  Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;  
   (3)  Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public but will be 
available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or  
   (4)  Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this definition

 “Computer database ” means a collection of data recorded in a form capable of being 
processed by a computer.  The term does not include computer software.  
 “Computer program ” means a set of instructions, rules, or routines recorded in a form 
that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.  
 “Computer software ” means computer programs, source code, source code listings,

 “Covered Government support contractor”  means a contractor (other than a litigation 
support contractor covered by 252.204 -7014) under a contract, the primary purpose of 
which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government ’s management and oversight of a 
program or effort, rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort, provided that the contractor—  
 2026 -O0036  
 27 
     (1)  Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first -tier subcontractor on the 
program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such

 “Developed ” means —  
   (1)  (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) 
An item, component, or process exists and is workable.  Thus, the item or component 
must have been constructed or the process practiced.  Workability is generally 
established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended.  Whether, how much, and what 
type of analysi s or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of 
the item, component, or process, and the state of the art.  To be considered “developed,” 
the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component, or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title  35 of the United States Code;  
   (2)  A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and 
tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art 
that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;  
   (3)  Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or 
analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose; or  
   (4)  Computer software documentation the contractor must deliver under a 
contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements under that contract.  
 “Developed exclusively at private expense”  means development was accomplished 
entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a Government contract, or any combination thereof.

clause, without alteration except to identify the parties, in any contractual instrument 
under which technical data or computer software will be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government .  This clause will govern the technical data 
related  to an other than commercial product or service or to any portion of a commercial 
product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expe nse, 
and the clause at 252.227- 7990  will govern the technical data related  to any portion of a 
commercial item that was developed exclusively at private expense.  No other clause 
shall be used to expand  or reduce  the Government ’s, the Contractor ’s, or a higher -tier

prime contract for data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such data or software directly to the Government, rather than through a higher -tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.  
   (4)  The Contractor and higher -tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use  the 
award  of a contract as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data, computer 
software, or computer software documentation from their subcontractors or suppliers.  
   (5)  In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect 
subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligations to the Go vernment.
