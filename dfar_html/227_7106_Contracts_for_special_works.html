    <h1>227.7106 Contracts for special works</h1>
    <pre>(a)(1)  Contracts primarily for the production or compilation of works first produced, 
created, or generated in the performance of a contract (special works) for the Government ’s own use, must specifically address the Government ’s rights to use, 
disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce the special works.   
   (2)(i)  Contracts may include negotiated terms controlling contractor use and 
distribution of special works by obtaining an assignment of copyright or obtaining indemnity for liabilities that might arise out of the content, performance, or disclosure of special wo rks.   
    (ii)  Negotiated terms may specify the purposes and conditions (including 
time limitations) under which the contractor may use, release, or reproduce the special works other than for contract performance.   
    (iii)  Such contract terms should not permit a contractor to incorporate into a 
special work any works copyrighted by others unless the contractor obtains the contracting officer’ s permission to do so and obtains for the Government a non -
exclusive, paid up, world- wide license to make and distribute copies of that work, to 
prepare derivative works, to perform or display publicly any portion of the work, and to 
permit others to do so for government purposes.   
    (iv)  Contracting officers should grant such permissions only when the 
Government ’s requirements cannot be satisfied unless the third party work is included 
in the deliverable work.  
  (b)  No specific contract clause governs the Government ’s rights in special works.  
Negotiate contract terms regarding control of, use, and distribution of special works — 
   (1)  When the Government must own or control copyright in all works first 
produced, created, or generated and which the contractor must deliver under a contract; or 
   (2)  In addition to the clause at 252.227- 7989  when the Government must own 
or control copyright in a portion of a work first produced, created, or generated and which  the contractor must deliver under a contract.  The specific portion in which the 
Government must own or control copyright must be identified in a special contract requirement.  
  (c)  See PGI 227.7106(c) for a list of examples of special works.
