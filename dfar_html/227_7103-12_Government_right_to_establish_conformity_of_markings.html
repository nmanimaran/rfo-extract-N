    <h1>227.7103-12 Government right to establish conformity of markings</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Nonconforming markings .  (1)  The marking requirements in the applicable 
clauses prescribe the content and format of authorized markings on technical data and computer software.  All other markings are nonconforming markings.  An authorized

 27 
   marking that is not in the form, or differs in substance, from the marking requirements 
in the clauses at 252.227- 7989  and 252.227- 7993  is also a nonconforming marking.  
   (2)  Notify the contractor or offeror of technical data or computer software 
bearing nonconforming markings to provide that person an opportunity to correct or strike the nonconforming marking at that person’s expense.   If the contractor or offeror 
fails to correct the nonconformity and deliver the corrected data within 60 days 
following the person ’s receipt of the data or software, the contracting officer may correct 
or strike the nonconformity at that person ’s expense.  Prior to correction, the 
Government may use the data in accordance with the proper restrictive marking.  
  (b)  Unjustified markings.  (1)  An unjustified marking is an authorized marking 
that does not accurately depict restrictions applicable to the Government ’s use, 
modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of the marked technical data or computer software.  Accordingly , a limited rights legend placed on 
technical data related  to items, components, or processes developed under a 
Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding (situations under which the Government obtains unlimited or government purpose rights) is an unjustified marking.  Similarly, a restricted rights legend placed on computer software developed under a Government contract either exclusively at Government expense or with mixed funding is an unjustified marking.  
   (2)  The contracting officer has  the right to review and challenge the validity of 
unjustified markings.  However, at any time during performance of a contract and 
notwithstanding existence of a challenge, the contracting officer and the person who has asserted a restrictive marking may agree that the restrictive marking is not justified.  Upon such agreement, the contracting officer may either — 
    (i)  Strike or correct the unjustified marking at that person ’s expense; or  
    (ii)  Instruct the person asserting the restriction to correct  the technical data 
or computer software at that person’s expense.  If the person fails to correct or strike the unjustified restriction and deliver the corrected data or software to the contracting 
officer within 60 days following this instruction , strike or correct the unjustified 
marking at that person ’s expense.</pre>
