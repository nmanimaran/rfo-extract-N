    <h1>210.001 Market research requirements</h1>
    <pre>(b)  In addition to the requirements of FAR 10.001( b)— 
   (i)(A)  Agencies must  conduct market research appropriate to the circumstances  
before issuing a solicitation with tiered evaluation of offers (section 816 of Pub. L. 109 - 
163); and  
    (B)  Contracting officers must u se the results of market research to 
determine whether the criteria in FAR part 19 are met for setting aside the acquisition for small business or, for a task or delivery order, whether there are a sufficient number of qualified small business concerns available to justify limiting competition under the terms of the contract.  If the contracting officer cannot determine whether the criteria are met, the contracting officer must  include a written explanation in the contract  file 
as to why such a determination could not be made (section 816 of Pub. L. 109 -163); and  
   (ii)  Contracting officers must  use market research, where appropriate, to 
inform price reasonableness determinations (see 212.204 (a) and 215.4). 
  (e)  Follow the procedures at PGI 210.001 (e) regarding contract file documentation.</pre>
