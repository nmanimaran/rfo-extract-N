    <h1>249.7003 Notification of anticipated contract terminations or reductions</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Section 1372 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 
(Pub. L. 103- 160) and section 824 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 1997 (Pub. L. 104 -201) are intended to help establish benefit eligibility under the 
Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U. S.C. Chapter 32) for employees of

anticipated termination of or substantial reduction in the funding of affected contracts — 
    (i)  Directly to the Secretary of Labor; and  
    (ii)  Through the contracting officer to each prime contractor.  
  (c)  When subcontracts have been issued, the prime contractor  is responsible for — 
   (1)  Providing notice of the termination or substantial reduction in funding to all 
first-tier subcontractors with a subcontract valued equal to or greater than $700,000; 
and 
   (2)  Requiring that each subcontractor — 
    (i)  Provide such notice to each of its subcontractors for subcontracts valued 
greater than $150,000; and  
    (ii)  Impose a similar notice and flowdown requirement in subcontracts 
valued greater than $150,000 at all tiers.</pre>
