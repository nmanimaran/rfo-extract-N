    <h1>PGI 217.7601 Provisioning</h1>
    <pre>(1)  Definitions .  As used in this section— 
   (i)  “Provisioning” means the process of determining and acquiring the range and 
quantity of spare and repair parts, and support and test equipment required to operate and maintain an end item for an initial period of service.  
   (ii)  “Provisioned item” means any item selected under provisioning procedures.  
   (iii)  “Provisioned items order” means an undefinitized order issued under a contract 
that includes the Government&#x27;s requirements for provisioned items.  (Provisioned items with 
 2026- O0027  
 firm prices are acquired by supplemental agreement or by separate contract.)  
 
  (iv)  “Provisioning activity” means the organization responsible for selecting and 
determining requirements for provisioned items.  
   (v)  “Provisioning requirements statement” means the contractual document listing 
the specific provisioning requirements for that contract.  The statement normally includes — 
    (A)  Instructions, such as the provisioning method to be used;  
    (B)  The extent of provisioning technical documentation and data needed 
(including administrative requirements for submission and distribution);  
    (C)  The type and location of provisioning conferences;  
    (D)  Sample article requirements;  
    (E)  The delivery schedule;  
    (F)  Packaging and marking requirements for provisioned items; and  
    (G)  Requirements for provisioning screening.  
   (vi)  “Provisioning technical documentation” means the data needed for the 
identification, selection, determination of initial requirements, and cataloging of support items 
to be acquired through the provisioning process.  It includes such things as prov isioning lists 
and logistics support analysis summaries.  Descriptive data such as drawings and photographs are referred to as “supplementary provisioning technical documentation.”  
  (2)  Contractual provisions .  Contracts containing provisioning requirements must — 
   (i)  List the provisioning functions to be performed and who will perform them;  
   (ii)  Include a provisioning requirements statement or specify a time limit for its 
incorporation into the contract by modification (revisions to the provisioning requirements statement must also be incorporated by contract modification);  
 
  (iii)  Include on the DD Form 1423, Contract Data Requirements List, a schedule for 
delivery of provisioning technical documentation, or provide for the schedule to be 
incorporated later by contract modification;  
   (iv)  Require flowdown of the appropriate provisioning technical documentation 
requirement when the subcontractor prepares the documentation;  
   (v)  Specify any applicable procedures for interim release by the contractor of long 
lead time items, and include ordering and funding instructions for such items.  As a 
 2026- O0027  
 minimum, the instructions must require the contractor to advise the contracting officer or 
provisioning activity at least 30 days before release of the items, their estimated costs, and 
the effective date of release;  
   (vi)  Specify the activity designated to issue provisioned items orders, i.e., 
contracting officer, provisioning activity, or administrative contracting officer.  When it is expected that more than one activity will place provisioned items orders against  the contract, 
state the requirements for provisioned items of each activity as separate contract line items;  
   (vii)  Provide a definitization schedule (normally 120 days after receipt of the 
contractor&#x27;s proposal) and a timeframe for the contractor to furnish price proposals for provisioned items orders (normally 60 days after order issuance);  
   (viii)  Specify exhibit identifiers applicable to the contract line/subline items; and  
   (ix)  Include procedures for processing changes (including cancellations) in 
quantities of items ordered.  
  (3)  Issuance of provisioned items orders . 
   (i)  Use the Standard Form 30, Amendment of Solicitation/Modification of Contract, 
to— 
    (A)  Issue provisioned items orders;  
 
   (B)  Decrease or cancel quantities of items ordered; and 
    (C)  Cover the contractor&#x27;s interim release of long lead items when the 
contracting officer approves the release (if the release is not approved, the contracting officer will notify the contractor to cancel the items).  
   (ii)  Include in Block 14 of the Standard Form 30—  
    (A)  The term PROVISIONED ITEMS ORDER in capital letters and underlined; 
and     (B)  The appropriate exhibit identifier(s) for all attached exhibits.  
   (iii)  Obligate funds to cover the estimated price of the items being ordered.  Show 
individual estimated prices for each exhibit line item on the accounting and payment office copies.  
   (iv)  Distribution is the same as for the basic contract (see FAR s ubpart 4.2).  
However, if the exhibits are voluminous, the contracting officer may restrict distribution of the exhibits to the contract administration office.  
 2026- O0027  
   (v)  See DFARS Subpart 217.74 for additional guidance and limitations on the use of 
undefinitized contract actions.  
 
 (4)  Provisioning conferences.   When requested by the contracting officer or provisioning 
activity, the contract administration office will assist the contracting officer or provisioning 
activity in scheduling and determining the types of provisioning conferences required, e.g., guidance meetings, long lead time items conferences, source coding meetings.  
  (5)  Contract administration office monitoring . 
  The contract administration office (CAO) will monitor contracts containing provisioning 
requirements.  As a minimum the CAO will—  
   (i)  Ensure that the contractor understands the provisioning requirements;  
   (ii)  Review contractor progress in the preparation of provisioning technical 
documentation and, if requested by the contracting officer or provisioning activity, inspect it for format and content;  
   (iii)  Ensure the prime contractor flows down provisioning requirements to any 
subcontractor charged with preparation of documentation;  
   (iv)  Advise the contracting office or provisioning activity of delays in delivery of 
provisioning technical documentation or other related problems (see FAR subpart 42.8);  
  (v)  Ensure contractor compliance with contract requirements concerning the 
assignment of national stock numbers; and  
   (vi)  Ensure that the contractor complies with contractual criteria for release of long 
lead time items.  
  (6)  Negotiating and executing supplemental agreements . 
   (i)  The administrative contracting officer (ACO) will definitize provisioned items 
orders within the prescribed schedule.  
   (ii)  If the provisioned items order does not contain a delivery date, or the contractor 
cannot meet the date, the ACO will coordinate the negotiated schedule with the contracting 
officer or provisioning activity before execution of the supplemental agreement.  
   (iii)  The ACO will maintain records of provisioned items orders showing—  
    (A)  The adequacy of obligated funds;  
    (B)  Due dates for price proposals; and 
 2026- O0027  
     (C)  Actions taken to obtain additional funds or to deobligate excess funds.</pre>
