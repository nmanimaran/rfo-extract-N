    <pre>(a)  This section applies to all multiyear contracts for supplies, including weapon 
systems and other multiyear acquisitions specifically authorized by law (10 U.S.C. 3501).  
  (b)  Multiyear contracts in amounts exceeding $ 900 million must be specifically 
authorized by law in an act other than an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(1)).  
 2026- O0027 
 17 
 (c)  The head of the agency may not initiate a multiyear procurement contract for 
any system (or component thereof) if the value of the multiyear contract exceed s $900 
million unless authority for the contract is specifically provided in an appropriations act (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(3)).  
  (d)  The head of the agency must  not enter into a multiyear contract unless — 
   (1)  The Secretary of Defense has submitted to Congress a budget request for  
full funding of units to be procured through the contract;  
   (2)  In the case of a contract for procurement of aircraft, the budget request 
includes full funding of procurement funds for production beyond advance procurement 
activities of aircraft units to be produced in the fiscal year covered by  the budget;  
 
  (3)  Cancellation provisions in the contract do not include consideration of the 
contractor’s recurring manufacturing costs associated with the production of unfunded 
units to be delivered under the contract;  
 
  (4)  The contract provides that payments to the contractor under the contract 
must  not be made in advance of incurred costs on funded units; and  
   (5)  The contract does not provide for a price adjustment based on a failure to 
award a follow -on contract (section 8010 of Division C, Title VIII, of the Consolidated 
and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub. L. 113- 235) and similar 
sections  in subsequent DoD appropriations acts).  
  (e)(1)  The head of the agency must not enter into or extend a multiyear contract 
that exceeds $ 900 million (when entered into or extended) until the Secretary of 
Defense identifies the contract and any extension in a report submitted to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 3501(l)(5)).  
   (2)  In addition, for contracts equal to or greater than $ 900 million, the head of 
the contracting activity must determine that the conditions required by paragraphs (g)(2)(i) through (vii) of this section will be met by such contract, in accordance with the 
Secretary’s certification and determination required by paragraph ( g)(2) of this section.  
  (f)  The head of the agency may enter into a multiyear contract for — 
   (1)  A weapon system and associated items, services, and logistics support for a 
weapon system (10 U.S.C. 3501(h)(1)); and  
   (2)  Advance procurement of components, parts, and materials necessary to 
manufacture a weapon system, including advance procurement to achieve economic lot purchases or more efficient production rates (see  paragraphs  (g)(3) and (4)  of this 
section  regarding economic order quantity procurements) (10 U.S.C. 3501(h)(2)).  Before 
initiating an advance procurement, the contracting officer must verify that it is consistent with DoD policy (e.g., the full funding policy in Volume 2A, chapter 1, of DoD 7000.14- R, Financial Management Regulation).  
  (g)  The head of the agency must  ensure that the following conditions are satisfied 
before awarding a multiyear contract for a defense acquisition program that has  been 
specifically authorized by law to be carried out using multiyear contract authority:  
 17 
  (1)  The multiyear exhibits required by DoD 7000.14- R, Financial Management 
Regulation, are included in the agency’s budget estimate submission and the President’s budget request.  
   (2)  The Secretary of Defense certifies to Congress in writing, by no later than 30 
days before entry into such contracts, that each of the conditions in paragraphs ( g)(2)(i) 
through (vii) of this section is satisfied (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)).  
    (i)  The Secretary has determined that each of the requirements in FAR 
17.103-1 , paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)( 7), will be met by such contract and has 
provided the basis for such determination to the congressional defense committees (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(A)).  
 
   (ii)  The Secretary’s determination under paragraph ( g)(2)(i) of this section 
was made after the completion of a cost analysis performed by the Defense Cost and 
Resource Center of the Department of Defense and such analysis supports the findings (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(B)).  
    (iii)  The system being acquired pursuant to such contract has not been 
determined to have experienced cost growth in excess of the critical cost growth threshold pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 4371(a)(3) within 5 years prior to the date the Secretary anticipates such contract (or a contract for advance procurement entered into consistent with the authorization for such contract) will be awarded (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(C)).  
    (iv)  A sufficient number of end items of the system being acquired under 
such contract have been delivered at or within the most current estimates of the program acquisition unit cost or procurement unit cost for such system to determine that current e stimates of such unit costs are realistic (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(D)).  
    (v)  Sufficient funds will be available in the fiscal year in which the contract 
will be awarded to perform the contract, and the future -years defense program for such 
fiscal year will include the funding required to execute the program without cancellation (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(E)).  
    (vi)  The contract is a fixed price type contract (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(F)).  
    (vii)  The proposed multiyear contract provides for production at not less 
than minimum economic rates, given the existing tooling and facilities (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(3)(G)).  The head of the agency must submit to OUSD(C)(P/B) information supporting the agency’s de termination that this requirement has been met . 
    (viii)  The head of the agency must submit information supporting this 
certification to OUSD(C)(P/B) for transmission to Congress through the Secretary of Defense.  
     (A)  The head of the agency must , as part of this certification, give 
written notification to the congressional defense committees of — 
      (1)  The cancellation ceiling amounts planned for each program year 
in the proposed multiyear contract, together with the reasons for the amounts planned;  
 2026- O0027 
 17 
      (2)  The extent to which costs of contract cancellation are not 
included in the budget for the contract; and  
 
     (3)  A financial risk assessment of not including the budgeting for 
costs of contract cancellation (10 U.S.C. 3501(g)); and  
     (B)  The head of the agency must  provide copies of the notification to the 
Office of Management and Budget at least 14 days before contract award.  
   (3)  The contract is for the procurement of a complete and usable end item (10 
U.S.C. 3501(i)(5)(A)).  
   (4)  Funds appropriated for any fiscal year for advance procurement are 
obligated only for the procurement of those long -lead items that are necessary in order 
to meet a planned delivery schedule for complete major end items that are programmed 
under the  contract to be acquired with funds appropriated for a subsequent fiscal year 
(including an economic order quantity of such long -lead items when authorized by law 
(10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(5)(B)).  
 
  (5)  The Secretary may make the certification under paragraph ( g)(2) of this 
section notwithstanding the fact that one or more of the conditions of such certification are not met if the Secretary determines that, due to exceptional circumstances, proceeding with a multiyear contract under this section is in the best interest of the Department of Defense and the Secretary provides the basis for such determination with the certification (10  U.S.C. 3501(i)(6)).  
   (6)  The Secretary of Defense may not delegate this authority to make the 
certification under paragraph ( g)(2) of this section or the determination under 
paragraph ( g)(5) of this section to an official below the level of the Under Secretary of 
Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(7)).  
   (7)  If the agency finds, after negotiations with the contractor(s), that the 
specified savings cannot be achieved, the head of the agency must  assess the savings 
that, nevertheless, could be achieved by using a multiyear contract.  If the savings are substantial, the head of the agency may request relief from the law’s specific savings requirement (10 U.S.C. 3501(i)(4)).  The request must 
    (i)  Quantify the savings that can be achieved;  
    (ii)  Explain any other benefits to the Government of using the multiyear 
contract;  
    (iii)  Include details regarding the negotiated contract terms and conditions; 
and 
    (iv)  Be submitted to OUSD(A&amp;S) /DPCAP for transmission to Congress via 
the Secretary of Defense and the President.  
  (i)  The Secretary of Defense may instruct the head of the agency proposing a 
multiyear contract to include in that contract negotiated priced options for varying the quantities of end items to be procured over the life of the contract (10 U.S.C. 3501(j)).  
  (j)  Any requests for increased  funding  or  reprogramming for procurement  of a 
 2026- O0027 
 17 
 major  system under  a  multiyear  contract must  be accompanied by an explanation of 
how the request for increased funding affects the determinations made by the Secretary 
of Defense under  paragraph (g)(2) of this section  (10 U.S.C. 3501(m)).</pre>
