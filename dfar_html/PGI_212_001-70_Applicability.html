    <pre>(b )  Commercial product or commercial service determination. 
    (A)  Making the commercial product or commercial service determination. 
     ( 1)  Before making a commercial product or commercial service  
determination, t he cont racting officer must search the DoD Commercial Item Database at  
https://piee.eb.mil
 for the item and an associated commercial product or commercial service  
determination or the decision that the item is not commercial in accordance with the commercial product or commercial service  definition at FAR 2.101.  
     ( 2)  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 3456(b)(1), the contracting officer 
may— 
      ( i)  Request support from the Defense Contract Management Agency 
(DCMA) by sending an email to DCMA Commercial Item Group (CIG) at 
dcma.boston-
ma.eastern -rc.mbx.Commercial@mail.mil ; 
      ( ii)  Request support from the cognizant Defense Contract Audit 
Agency (DCAA) office;  
      ( iii)  Request support from other appropriate experts in DoD such as 
program office technical evaluators, program managers, cognizant engineers, or other contracting officers; or  
      (iv)  Consider the views of appropriate public and private sector 
entities such as documents provided by the contractor asserting commerciality to include technical drawings, product or catalog descriptions, or national stock numbers.  
     ( 3)  The contracting officer may make the commercial product or  
commercial service  determination or the decision that the item is other than commercial  
in accordance with the commercial product or commercial service  definition at FAR 
2.101 or request a DCMA  CIG contracting officer  make the determination or the decision  
that the product or service is other than commercial in accordance with the commercial  
product or commercial service definition at FAR 2.101 by submitting a request to 
dcma.boston- ma.eastern -rc.mbx.Commercial@mail.mil
.  The contracting officer may 
withdraw the request at any point prior to the determination being made.  
    (B)  Documenting the commercial product or commercial service determination . 
     ( 1)  The contracting officer making the determination must  document the  
market research and rationale supporting a conclusi on that the product or service is 
commercial or is other than commercial  and include it in the contract file. 
     ( 2)  Particular care must be taken when documenting determinations  
 12 
 involving items that are of a type customarily used by the general public or by 
nongovernmental entities, modifications of a type customarily available in the marketplace, 
and items only offered for sale, lease, or license to the general public but not yet actually sold, leased, or licensed.  In these situations, the documentation must clearly detail the particulars of the items and modifications of a type and sales offers.  When such items lack 
sufficient market pricing in formation, additional diligence must be given to determinations 
that prices are fair and reasonable as required by FAR subpart 15.4 . 
     ( 3)  The contracting officer must include the part number, the national stock  
number, or both, as applicable, in the commercial product or commercial service determination or the decision that the product or service does not meet the commercial  
product or commercial service definition at FAR 2.101.  
     ( 4)  The c ontracting officer must include the commercial product or 
commercial service  determination or the decision that the product or service does not  
meet the commercial product or commercial service definition at FAR 2.101 in the 
contract file.  
    (C)  DoD commercial item database.  In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 
3456(b)(2), w ithin 30 days of contract award, the contracting officer making the  
determination must  upload the signed commercial product or service  determination or the  
decision that the item does not meet the commercial product or commercial service definition at FAR 2.101  to the DoD Commercial Item Database at  https://piee.eb.mil
.  The 
only documentation that is required to be uploaded to the database is the commercial  
product or service determination or the decision that the item is other than commercial .  
Contracting officers must  avoid uploading any data marked as proprietary or controlled 
unclassified in formation to the Commercial Item Database.   Additional in formation is 
available at https://www.dcma.mil/commercial -item-group/ . 
    (D )  Prior commercial product or commercial service determination . 
     ( 1)  If a prior DoD commercial product or commercial service  determination 
for the same product or service  is made by a military department, defense agency, or  
another component of DoD, contracting officers may presume that the prior commercial  
product or commercial service determination must  serve as a determination for subsequent 
procurements of such product or service, unless the process is followed to overturn the prior determination.      ( 2)  If the DoD Commercial Item Database contains a prior decision that a  
product or service does not meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial  
service  at FAR 2.101, the contracting officer may use the prior decision to serve as the  
decision for subsequent procurements of the same product or service .  To promote  
consistent acquisition procedures across DoD, contracting officers should c onsult  
contracting activities that regularly procure the product or service to understand the 
basis for determining that the product or service does not meet the commercial product 
or commercial service  definition at FAR 2.101.  
   (v)  Commercial product or commercial service guidebook .  See the  
Department of Defense Guidebook for Acquiring Commercial Items, Part A: Commercial 
Item Determination , for detailed guidance and practical examples on improving the  
 12 
 consistency and timeliness of commercial product or commercial service  determinations to 
include a template for new commercial product or commercial service determinations and 
for general inf ormation related to commercial products or commercial services.  
 
 (d)(1)  This permissive authority is intended to enhance defense innovation and 
investment, enable DoD to acquire items that otherwise might not have been available, and create incentives for nontraditional defense contractors to do business with DoD.  It  is not 
intended to recategorize current other than commercial products or commercial services; however, when appropriate, contracting officers may consider applying commercial product or commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and ser vices from 
business segments that meet the definition of “nontraditional defense contractor” even though they have been established under traditional defense contractors.  The decision to apply commercial product and commercial service procedures to the procurement of supplies and services from nontraditional defense contractors does not require a commercial product or commercial service determination and does not mean the item is commercial.</pre>
