    <h1>PGI 233.171 Reporting requirement for protests of solicitations or awards</h1>
    <pre>(a) The Protest Tracker on the Procurement Integrated Enterprise Environment 
(PIEE) (accessible at  https://piee.eb.mil/ ) is the bid protest data repository required by 
Section 822(c) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Pub. L. 
115-232).   
  (b)  When protests involving the same contract or proposed award, valued at any 
amount, have been filed at both the Government Accountability Office and the U.S.  
Court of Federal Claims (COFC), the contracting officer will report the protest 
information required in the Protest Tracker no later than 10 days after the outcome of the protest at the COFC.   
  (c)  Instructions for reporting protest information in the Protest Tracker are available 
on the PIEE webpage.</pre>
