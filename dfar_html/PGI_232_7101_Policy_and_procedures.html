    <h1>PGI 232.7101 Policy and procedures</h1>
    <pre>Background.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is authorized to collect overdue taxes through a continuous levy up to 100 percent of the debt on certain vendor contract payments disbursed by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service.  The levy is continuous until the overdue taxes are paid in full, or other arrangements are made to 
satisfy the debt.  Contractors are required to promptly notify the procuring contracting officer when a tax levy that may result in an inability to perform the contract is imposed, so that the contracting officer and the Principal Director, Defense Pricing, Contracting, 
and Acquisition Policy  (DPCAP), can take appropriate action to mitigate any possible 
adverse effect on national security.  
  (b)  Procuring contracting officer procedures for reviewing the contractor’s rationale 
and submitting the required documentation.    (i)  When the procuring contracting officer receives notification from the 
contractor that the tax levy may result in an inability to perform  the contract , the 
procuring contracting officer must  promptly review the contractor’s assessment and 
 32 
  either agree or disagree that the levy may result in an inability to perform.  The 
procuring contracting officer must  alert the administrative contracting officer and the 
cognizant contract auditor when a notice of levy has been received and must  obtain any 
necessary assistance from the administrative contracting officer or contract auditor when performing this review.  
   (ii)  If the procuring contracting officer does not agree with the contractor’s 
assessment, the procuring contracting officer must  notify the contractor of this 
determination,  and no further action will be taken.  
   (iii)  If the procuring contracting officer agrees with the contractor’s assessment 
that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, the procuring contracting officer must  document, in writing, whether the inability to perform — 
    (A)  Adversely affects national security; and/or  
    (B)  Will result in significant additional costs to the Government (e.g., cost of  
re-procurement, loss of contract financing payments when the product produced to date 
is not salvageable).  
   (iv)  If the procuring contracting officer believes that the levy will impact national 
security and/or result in significant additional costs to DoD, the procuring contracting officer must , in accordance with agency procedures, promptly notify the Principal 
Director, DP CAP, via email at 
osd.pentagon.ousd-a- s.mbx.asda- dp-c-
contractpolicy@mail.mil .  The notification to the Principal D irector, DP CAP, must 
include — 
    (A)  The rationale supporting the recommendation that the levy may result in 
an inability to perform the contract;  
    (B)  A description of the adverse effect on national security, if applicable; 
and 
    (C)  A description and estimate of the additional costs to the Government, if 
applicable.  Since prompt notification to the Principal Director, DP CAP, is essential, t he 
procuring contracting officer should not delay the notification while trying to achieve more precise data.  
  (c)  Principal Director, DP CAP, procedures .  The Principal Director, DP CAP, will 
promptly evaluate the procuring contracting officer’s notification package.  
   (i)  If the Principal Director, DPCAP, disagrees with the recommendation of the 
procuring contracting officer, the Principal Director, DPCAP, will notify the procuring contracting officer through the same agency channels that were used for submission of the notification.  
   (ii)  If the Principal Director, DPCAP, agrees with the recommendation of the 
procuring contracting officer — 
    (A)  When there is an adverse effect on national security, the Principal 
Director, DPCAP, will notify the payment office, the IRS , and the procuring contracting 
officer that the total amount of the levy should be promptly returned to the contractor ; or 
   (B)  When there is not an adverse e ffect on national security , but the levy will

 32 
  result in significant additional costs to DoD, the Principal Director, DPCAP, will promptly 
notify the procuring contracting officer and the IRS.  The Principal Director, DPCAP, 
notification to the IRS will — 
 
    (1)  State that the procuring contracting officer has notified the 
contractor and has recommended that the contractor contact the IRS to resolve the situation;  
     (2)  Request that the IRS expedite resolution of the situation with the 
contractor; and  
     (3)  Include an estimate of additional costs to DoD that will result if the 
contractor is unable to perform on the contract.  
  (d)  Procuring contracting officer procedures for notifying the contractor of the 
decision of the Principal Director, DP CAP.  The procuring contracting officer shall 
promptly notify the contractor, in writing, of the decision made by the Principal Director, DPCAP, including the actions to be taken (if any).</pre>
