    <h1>PGI 218.7001-7 Use of  electronic business tools</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Use of electronic business (e- business) acquisition tools greatly enhances the 
efficacy of the contracting process in emergency -type operations (ETOs) .  ETOs can benefit 
from specific tools, policies, roles and responsibilities, and processes necessary to 
streamline delivery of goods and services to the end user .  ETOs also can benefit from  
 implement ing an e-business program with the capabilities necessary to support an end- to-
end electronic acquisition process in order to quickly obtain goods and services for the 
warfighter in an operational area.  For additional information and resources pertaining to 
contingency  e-business tools, see the Defense Pricing, Contracting, and Acquisition Policy 
contingency contracting resources page at: https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/cp/cc/cc -
resources.html . 
  (b)  Use of the following contingency  e-business tools is mandatory when automating the 
respective acquisition process during a contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping 
operation:  
   (1)  The 3in1 Tool.  The 3in1 Tool automates the field order, receipt, and purchase 
processes previously executed manually using the paper Standard Form (SF) 44.  The 3in1 handheld device records and transmits cash and carry type purchases and payment data to the prime database for remote reconciliation and review, when conducting on- the-spot, over -
the-counter field purchases where use of the Government Purchase Card is appropriate, but 
not feasible.  The 3in1 database may be accessed on the Joint Contingency and Expeditionary Services (JCXS) website at https://www.jccs.gov/JCCSCOE . 
   (2)  The Acquisition Cross -Servicing Agreements (ACSA) Global Automated 
Tracking and Reporting System (AGATRS).  AGATRS is an automated tool that tracks and provides visibility into worldwide ACSAs that may satisfy a requirement through support from the host nation or other nations supporting the operation .  ACSA  transactions that are used 
in support of contingency or humanitarian or peacekeeping operations are required to be documented and tracked in AGATRS as required by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs  of 
Staff Instruction 2120.01D , Acquisition  and Cross Servicing Agreements  
(https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/CJCSI%202120.01E.pdf) .  
AGATRS is accessible on the JCXS website at https://www.jccs.gov/JCCSCOE . 
  (c)  No other electronic tools may be used to fulfill the same capabilities as 3in1 and 
AGATRS.  
  (d)  See PGI 225  regarding use of the Theater Business  Clearance e- business tool.</pre>
