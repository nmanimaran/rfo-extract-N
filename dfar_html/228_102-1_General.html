    <h1>228.102-1 General</h1>
    <pre>The requirement for performance and payment bonds is waived for cost -reimbursement 
contracts.  However, for cost- type contracts with fixed- price construction subcontracts 
over $40,000, require the prime contractor to obtain from each of its construction subcontractors performance and payment protections in favor of the prime contractor as 
follows:  
  (1)  For fixed -price construction subcontracts over $40,000, but not exceeding 
$150,000, payment protection sufficient to pay labor and material costs, using any of the alternatives listed at FAR 28.102- 1(b)(1).  
  (2)  For fixed -price construction subcontracts over $150,000 — 
   (i)  A payment bond sufficient to pay labor and material costs; and  
   (ii)  A performance bond in an equal amount if available at no additional cost.</pre>
