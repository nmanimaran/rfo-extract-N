    <h1>250.104-370 Indemnification under contracts involving both research and</h1>
    <pre>development and other work.  
 
When indemnification is to be provided on contracts requiring both research and 
development work and other work, the contracting officer must  insert an 
appropriate clause using the authority of both 10 U.S.C. 3861 and Pub. L. 85- 804. 
 
 (a) The use of Pub. L. 85- 804 is limited to work which cannot be indemnified 
under 10 U.S.C. 3861 and is subject to compliance with FAR 50.104.  
 
(b) Indemnification under 10 U.S.C. 3861 is covered by  235.070.
