 that is used in the automatic acquisition, storage, analysis, evaluation, 
manipulation, management, movement, control, display, switching, interchange, transmission, or reception of data or information by the agency.  
   (1)  For purposes of this definition, equipment is used by an agency if the 
equipment is used by the agency directly or is used by a contractor under a contract with the agency that requires — 
    (i)  Its use; or  
    (ii)  To a significant extent, its use in the performance of a service or the 
furnishing of a product.  
   (2)  The term “information technology” includes computers, ancillary 
equipment (including imaging peripherals, input, output, and storage devices necessary for security and surveillance), peripheral equipment designed to be controlled by the central processing  unit of a computer, software, firmware and 
similar procedures, services (including support services), and related resources.  
   (3)  The term “information technology” does not include any equipment 
acquired by a contractor incidental to a contract.  
  Supply chain risk  means the risk that an adversary may sabotage, maliciously 
introduce unwanted function, or otherwise subvert the design, integrity, manufacturing, production, distribution, installation, operation, or maintenance of 
a covered system so as to surveil, deny , disrupt, or otherwise degrade the function, 
use, or operation of such system (see 10 U.S.C. 3252).  
  (b)  The Contractor shall mitigate supply chain risk in the provision of supplies 
and services to the Government.  
  (c)  In order to manage supply chain risk, the Government may use the 
authorities provided by 10 U.S.C. 3252.  In exercising these authorities, the Government may consider information, public and non -public, including all -source 
intelligence, relating to a Contractor&#x27;s supply chain.  
  (d)  If the Government exercises the authority provided in 10 U.S.C. 3252 to 
limit disclosure of information, no action undertaken by the Government under such authority shall be subject to review in a bid protest before the Government Accountability Office or in any Federal court.
