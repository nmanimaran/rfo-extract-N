PG
I 237. 876  Certification of nonpersonal services. 
To comply with the certification requirement at DFARS  237.876, complete a 
certification substantially the same as the following and include a copy in the 
contract file:  
Certification of Nonpersonal Services  
 Thi
s certification and enclosed worksheet are  designed to ensure that the agency 
does not award a personal -services contract unless specifically authorized by statute 
(e.g., 10 U.S.C. 129b, 5 U.S.C. 3109, or 10 U.S.C. 1091).  Therefore, this documentation should be completed in conjunction with the submission of a service-contract requirement to the contracting officer.  
 A
 personal services contract is characterized by the employer -employee 
relationship it creates between the Government and the contractor’s personnel.  The Government is normally required to obtain its employees by direct hire under competitive appointment procedures required by civil service laws.  Obtaining personal services by contract, rather than by direct hire, circumvents those laws unless Congress has specifically authorized acquisition of the services by contract.   
 A
n employer -employee relationship under a service contract occurs when the 
Government exercises relatively continuous supervision and control over contractor personnel performing the contract.   
   Upon considering the information above and the worksheet below, I certify that 
this requirement does not include an unauthorized personal services arrangement, 
either in the way the work statement is written or in the manner in which the resulting contract will be managed and overseen.

 Personal Services  
The following descriptive elements should be used as a 
guide to assess whether  a proposed contract is 
personal in nature (see FAR 37. 201-2).  If the answer 
to any of the items below is “YES,” then additional 
measures should be taken to ensure the contract is not 
administered so as to create an employer -employee 
relationship between the Government and the 
contractor’s personnel and result in an unauthorized 
personal services contract.  YES NO 
1. Contractor personnel are performing on a Government 
site.   
2. Principal tools and equipment are furnished by the 
Government .   
3. Services are applied directly to the integral effort of the 
agency or an organizational subpart in furtherance of 
assigned function or mission.    
4. Comparable services meeting comparable needs are 
performed in this agency or similar agencies using civil -
service personnel.    
5. The need for the service provided can reasonably be 
expected to last beyond one year.    
6. The inherent nature of the service, or the manner in which 
it is to be provided, reasonably requires (directly or indirectly) Government direction or supervision of contractor employees in order to:  
(a) adequately protect the Government’s interest;  
(b) retain control of the function involved; or  
(c) retain full personal responsibility for the function supported in a duly authorized Federal officer or 
employee .</pre>
