    <pre>(a)  Establishing or maintaining alternative sources.   PGI contains a sample format for 
Determination and Findings citing the authority of FAR part 6, regarding exclusion of a 
particular source in order to establish or maintain an alternative source or sources.  Alternate 2 of the sample format addresses having a supplier available for furnishing supplies or services in case of a national emergency.  See PGI 206.  
  (b)  Electronic submission and processing of payment requests.   Contractors do not 
have to submit payment requests in electronic form for contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to natural disasters or national or civil emergencies.  See part 232.</pre>
