    <h1>234.7202 Procedures</h1>
    <pre>(a)  Selection of contract type for major acquisition programs at Milestone B .  For 
major defense acquisition programs at Milestone B — 
   (1)  The milestone decision authority (MDA) must select, with the advice of the 
contracting officer, the contract type for a development program at the time of Milestone B approval or, in the case of a space program, Key Decision Point B approval;  
   (2)  The acquisition strategy must document the basis for the contract -type 
selection. The documentation — 
    (i)  Must include an explanation of the level of program risk; and  
    (ii)  If program risk is determined to be high, must outline the steps taken to 
reduce program risk and the reasons for proceeding with Milestone B approval despite the risk; and  
   (3)  If the MDA selects a cost -reimbursement type contract, include in the 
contract file the MDA&#x27;s written determination that — 
    (i)  The program is so complex and technically challenging that reducing 
program risk to a level that would permit the use of a fixed- price type contract is 
impracticable; and  
    (ii)  The complexity and technical challenge of the program does not result 
from failure to meet the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 4251.  
  (b)  Use of cost -reimbursement line items for production of major defense acquisition 
programs.   (1)  Do not use cost -reimbursement line items for the acquisition of 
production of major defense acquisition programs.  
   (2)  The prohibition at paragraph (1) does not apply where the Under Secretary 
of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment (USD(A&amp;S)), or the MDA when the MDA is the service acquisition executive of the military department that is managing the program, su bmits to the congressional defense committees — 
    (i) A written certification that the cost -reimbursement line items are needed 
to provide a required capability in a timely and cost -effective manner; and  
    (ii) An explanation of the steps taken to ensure that cost -reimbursement line 
items are used only to achieve the purposes of the exception.

  (3)  Include, as applicable, in the contract file a copy of the congressional 
certification described in paragraph (2).  
  
 (c)  Low-rate initial production associated with major defense acquisition programs.   
(1)  Do not procure more than one lot for low -rate initial production, as defined at 10 
U.S.C. 4231, associated with a major defense acquisition program if — 
    (i)  The MDA authorizes the use of a fixed -price type contract at the time of 
Milestone B approval; and  
    (ii)  The scope of work of the fixed -price type contract includes both the 
development and low -rate initial production of items for such major defense acquisition 
program.  
   (2)  The service acquisition executive may waive this limitation, delegable to no 
lower than one level above the contracting officer, if — 
    (i)  The service acquisition executive provides a written notification of the 
waiver, including associated rationale, to the congressional defense committees no later than 30 days after issuance of the waiver; and  
    (ii)  Include a copy of the waiver and such congressional notification in the 
contract file.  
   
 (d)  Sustainment criteria for weapons systems.  (1) As provided by the program 
manager, include clearly defined measurable criteria for engineering activities and design specifications for reliability and maintainability in solicitations and resulting contracts for the technical maturation and risk reduction phase, the engineering and 
manufacturing development phase or the production phase  of a weapon system, 
including embedded software.  
   (2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if the program manager has determined 
that such criteria should not be included as described in paragraph (1), include a copy of the justification, executed by the program manager, in the contract file.  
  (e)  Development and demonstration of initial or additional prototype units .  (1)  
Subject to the limitations in paragraph (2), a contract initially awarded from the competitive selection of a proposal resulting from a broad agency announcement (see 235.016) may include —  
    (i)  A line item or contract option using funds not limited to those identified 
in 235.016 for the development and demonstration or initial production of technology developed under the contract; or  
    (ii)  The delivery of initial or additional items if the item or a prototype 
thereof is created as the result of work performed under the contract.  
   (2)(i)  The line item or contract option must require only the minimal quantity of 
initial or additional items or prototypes that will allow for timely competitive solicitation and award of a follow -on development or production contract for those items.

 34 
   (ii)  The term of the line item or contract option must not exceed 2 years.  
 
   (iii)  The dollar value of the work to be performed pursuant to the line item 
or contract option must not exceed $100 million in fiscal year 2017 constant dollars.  
   (3)  See PGI 234.7202(e) regarding the benefits derived from use of this 
competitive selection method.
