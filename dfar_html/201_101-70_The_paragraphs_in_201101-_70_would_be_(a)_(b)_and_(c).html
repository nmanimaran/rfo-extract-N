    <h1>201.101-70 The paragraphs in 201.101- 70 would be (a), (b), and (c)</h1>
    <pre>(b )  Text that implements the FAR uses the same numbering as its FAR counterpart.  
However, when the text uses a different number of paragraphs than the FAR, the text uses supplemental numbering.  
   (c )  Paragraph numbering below the 4th level (i.e., (A)) does not repeat the numbering 
sequence.  It uses italicized Arabic numerals (e.g., 1) at the 5th level and then italicized 
lower case Roman numerals (e.g., i ) at the final level.  
  (d )  Example s of DFARS numbering are  in Table 1, DFARS Numbering.  
  (e )  Department, agency, and component supplements must parallel the FAR and 
DFARS numbering, except department and agency supplemental numbering uses section numbers of 90 and up, instead of 70 and up.
