    <h1>PGI 219.102 Coordination</h1>
    <pre>(a)(1)  Small business specialists are appointed and perform functions in accordance 
with DoD Instruction (DoDI) 4205.01, DoD Small Business Programs.  In the DoDI, small 
business specialists are called “small business professionals.”  
 
  (2 )  The responsibility for assigning small business technical advisors is delegated to 
the head of the contracting activity.  
  (g)(1)  Small business specialists — 
    (i )  Review and make recommendations for all acquisitions over the micro-
purchase threshold, except those under the simplified acquisition threshold that are totally set aside for small business concerns (see FAR 19.104- 1); 
    ( ii)  Review acquisitions before issuance of the solicitation or contract 
modification, and document it on DD Form 2579, Small Business Coordination Record (see PGI 253.219 -70 for instructions on completing the form); and  
    ( iii)  Refer recommendations that have been rejected by the contracting officer to 
the Small Business Administration (SBA) procurement center representative. If an SBA procurement center representative is not assigned, see FAR 19.102(b)(2).  
   (2 )(i)  Agencies may require small business specialists to review actions over the 
micro -purchase threshold, but under the simplified acquisition threshold, that are totally set 
aside for small business.  Such reviews may be conducted when the agency determines a review is necessary to assist contracting officers in identifying opportunities for other small business set -aside programs (e.g., HUBZone, service- disabled veteran -owned, small 
disadvantaged business, women- owned small business) to meet small business goals.  
 
   ( ii)  Small business specialists should review contract or order modifications that 
increase the scope.  At a minimum, these modifications can impact subcontracting plans. 
Funding- only modifications or those not increasing scope generally should not be reviewed 
due to minimal added value.</pre>
