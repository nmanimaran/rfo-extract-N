<p class="p Ctr_SmCaps" id="FAR_52_213_4__d3167e15">Terms and Conditions—Simplified Acquisitions (Noncommercial) (DEVIATION DATE)</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>
<em class="ph i">Inspection/Acceptance</em>. The Contractor shall only
        tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The
        Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been
        tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming
        supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If
        repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the
        Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of
        nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post acceptance
        rights—</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Within a reasonable period of time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
<em class="ph i">Excusable delays</em>. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence. Examples of occurrences include acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. When an excusable delay occurs, the Contractor shall—</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as possible;</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Remedy the delay as quickly as possible; and</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Notify the Contracting Officer when the occurrence is over.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
<em class="ph i">Termination for the Government’s convenience</em>. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred which reasonably could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
<em class="ph i">Termination for cause</em>. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. The Government will send a cure notice to the Contractor, unless the reason for the termination is late delivery. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>
<p class="ListL1">
<span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>
<em class="ph i">Warranty</em>. The Contractor warrants and implies that the items delivered hereunder are merchantable and fit for use for the particular purpose described in this contract.</p>
