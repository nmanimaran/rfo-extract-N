      Upon receipt of a stop-work order, the Contractor must immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize incurring costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period of work stoppage. After receiving the final decision in the protest, the Contracting Officer must either—

      If a stop-work order issued under this clause is canceled either before or after a final decision in the protest, the Contractor must resume work.

      If, as the result of the Contractor's intentional or negligent misstatement, misrepresentation, or miscertification, a protest related to this contract is sustained, and the Government pays costs, the Government may require the Contractor to reimburse the Government the amount of such costs. In addition to any other remedy available, and pursuant to the requirements of subpart 32.6, the Government may collect this debt by offsetting the amount against any payment due the Contractor under any contract between the Contractor and the Government.
