<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Contractors must settle with subcontractors following the same policies and principles used for prime contract settlements in this subpart and subparts 49.2 or 49.3. However, the prime contractor or next higher tier subcontractor must accept the basis and form of the subcontractor's settlement proposal. Each settlement must have enough accounting data and other information for the Government to adequately review it. The Government will never pay the prime contractor any amount for lost anticipated profits or consequential damages from terminating any subcontract (but see 49.108-5).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e24"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Except as provided in 49.108-4, the TCO must require that-</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e33"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> All subcontractor termination inventory be disposed of and accounted for following the procedures in paragraph (j) of clause 52.245-1, Government Property; and</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e41"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The prime contractor submit all termination settlements with subcontractors for approval or ratification.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> The TCO must quickly examine each subcontract settlement received to determine whether-</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e61"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The subcontract termination was necessary because of the prime contract termination (or because of a change order—see 49.002(c));</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_3__d2884e66"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The settlement was made in good faith;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The settlement amount is reasonable; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The settlement is allocable to the terminated portion of the contract (or if only partially allocable, that the proposed allocation is reasonable).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When considering if any subcontract settlement is reasonable, the TCO must generally follow the provisions in this part for settling prime contracts. The TCO must also comply with any applicable requirements in 49.106 and 49.111 for accounting and other reviews. After the examination, the TCO must notify the contractor in writing of—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Approval or ratification; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The reasons for disapproval.</p></div>
