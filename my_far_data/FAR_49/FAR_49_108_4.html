This requires a written request from the contractor. The TCO may grant this authorization if—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e24"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The TCO is satisfied with the adequacy of the procedures used by the contractor in settling settlement proposals, including proposals for keeping, selling, or otherwise disposing of termination inventory of the immediate and lower tier subcontractors. The TCO must obtain advice and recommendations from—</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e30"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> The appropriate audit agency about the adequacy of the contractor's audit administration, including personnel; and</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e35"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The cognizant plant clearance officer about the adequacy of the contractor's procedures and personnel for handling property disposal matters;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e40"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Any termination inventory included in determining the settlement amount will be disposed of as directed by the prime contractor, except that disposing of the inventory will not be subject to-</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Review by the TCO under 49.108-3(c); or</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e54"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The screening requirements in 45.602-3; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e62"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> A certificate similar to the certificate in the settlement proposal form in 49.602-1(a) will accompany the settlement.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e70"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Except as stated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, authority granted to a prime contractor under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by any TCO must apply to all Executive agencies' prime contracts that are terminated or modified by change orders.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e75"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Except as stated in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the TCO must accept settlements of terminated lower tier subcontracts as part of the prime contractor's settlement proposal. This applies when the settlements are completed by any of the prime contractor's immediate or lower-tier subcontractors who have been granted authority as prime contractors to settle subcontracts, provided that the settlement is within the limit of the authority. Authorization to settle proposals of lower-tier subcontractors must not be granted directly to subcontractors. However, a prime contractor authorized to approve subcontractor settlements may also exercise this authority when acting as a subcontractor for its terminated subcontracts and orders. When exercising this authority as a subcontractor, the contractor must notify the purchaser.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e80"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section do not apply to contracts under the administration of any contracting officer if the contracting officer notifies the prime contractor concerned. This notice must—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e86"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Be in writing; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e91"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If paragraph (a)(3) of this section is involved, specify any subcontractor affected.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e96"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Section 45.602 must apply to disposal of completed end items allocable to the terminated subcontract. However, these items may be disposed of without review by the TCO under 49.108-3 and without screening under 45.602-3, if the items do not require demilitarization and the total amount (at the subcontract price) when added to the settlement amount does not exceed the amount authorized under this section.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e110"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> A TCO granting the authorization in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must periodically (at least annually) make a selective review of settlements and settlement procedures. This review determines if the contractor is making adequate reviews and fair settlements, and whether the authorization should remain in effect. The TCO must obtain advice and recommendations from the appropriate audit agency and the cognizant plant clearance officer. The TCO must revoke the authorization by written notice to the contractor, effective on the date of receipt, when—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contractor's procedures are not adequate;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Improper settlements are being made; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The authority has not been used in the preceding 2 years.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e115"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The contractor may make any number of separate settlements with a single subcontractor but must not divide settlement proposals solely to bring them under an authorization limit. Separate settlement proposals that would normally be included in a single proposal, such as those based on a series of separate orders for the same item under one contract, must be consolidated whenever possible.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e120"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Upon written request of the contractor, the TCO may increase an authorization granted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section to authorize the contractor to conclude settlements under a particular prime contract. The TCO may limit the increased authorization to specific subcontracts or classes of subcontracts.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_108_4__d2885e125"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> Authorizations granted under 49.108-4 do not authorize the settlement of requisitions or orders placed with any unit within the contractor's corporate entity.</p></div>
