                <h2>49.206Settlement proposals.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_1__d2913e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Subject to the termination clause, the contractor should quickly submit a settlement proposal to the TCO for the amount claimed because of the termination. The final settlement proposal must be submitted within one year from the termination date, unless the TCO allows more time. If a single contract involves two or more divisions of the contractor, they can combine their termination costs in a single settlement proposal.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_1__d2913e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The settlement proposal must cover all cost elements including settlements with subcontractors and any proposed profit. With the TCO's agreement, proposals may be filed in steps covering separate parts of costs. These step-by-step proposals must include all costs of a particular type, unless the TCO says otherwise.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_1__d2913e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Settlement proposals must be on the forms prescribed in 49.602 unless those forms do not work for a particular contract. Settlement proposals must have reasonable detail supported by adequate accounting data. Actual costs, standard costs (properly adjusted), or average costs may be used if the contractor determines them based on generally accepted accounting principles consistently followed by the contractor. When actual, standard, or average costs are not reasonably available, estimated costs may be used if the TCO approves the estimation method. Contractors do not have to maintain overly complicated cost accounting systems just because their contracts might be terminated.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_1__d2913e28"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The contractor should use Settlement Proposal (Short Form), SF 1438, when the total proposal is less than $10,000, unless the TCO authorizes otherwise. Combine settlement proposals that would normally go together whenever possible, such as those based on a series of separate orders for the same item under one contract. Do not split them up just to bring them below $10,000.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_206_1__d2913e45"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Submit Schedule of Accounting Information, SF 1439, for each termination requiring a settlement proposal, except when using Standard Form 1438. Even if several step-by-step proposals are submitted, only one SF 1439 should be submitted unless major changes happen in the information after the original form is filed.</p></div>
