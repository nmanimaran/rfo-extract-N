<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_402_6__d2942e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Generally, the contracting officer decides whether to repurchase before issuing the termination notice when supplies or services are still needed after termination. Guidelines for repurchasing are as follows:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must repurchase similar items against the contractor's account as soon as practical.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The price must be reasonable considering quality and delivery requirements.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contracting officer may buy more than the undelivered quantity if needed.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Extra cost can only be charged to the contractor for the undelivered quantity (including permitted variations).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_402_6__d2942e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> For repurchases limited to the undelivered quantity-</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The Default clause allows the contracting officer to use any terms and acquisition method;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contracting officer must maximize competition;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The Default clause serves as the authority; and</p><p class="ListL2">For quantities exceeding the undelivered amount, treat the entire purchase as a new acquisition.<span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span></p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_49_402_6__d2942e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> If the repurchase costs more than the terminated supplies or services, after completing the repurchase contract, the contracting officer must demand payment from the contractor for the excess amount. This calculation should account for changes in transportation costs, discounts, etc. If the contractor does not pay, follow the procedures in part 32 for collecting contract debts.</p></div>
