Agencies may contract without providing for full and open competition when the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured, financially or otherwise, unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of sources from which it solicits bids or proposals.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Period of performance</em>.

The justification and approval for the use of this authority, as well as the determination described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, may be made after contract award when making the determination before award would unreasonably delay the acquisition.</p></div>
