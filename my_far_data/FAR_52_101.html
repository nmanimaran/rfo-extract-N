<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Definition</em>. "Modification," as used in this subpart, means a minor change in the details of a provision or clause that is specifically authorized by the FAR and does not alter the substance of the provision or clause (see 52.104).</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Numbering—</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e27"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">FAR provisions and clauses</em>. subpart  52.2 sets forth the text of all FAR provisions and clauses, each in its own separate subsection. The subpart is arranged by subject matter, in the same order as, and keyed to, the parts of the FAR. Each FAR provision or clause is uniquely identified. All FAR provision and clause numbers begin with "52.2," since the text of all FAR provisions and clauses appear in subpart  52.2. The next two digits of the provision or clause number correspond to the number of the FAR subject part in which the provision or clause is prescribed. The FAR provision or clause number is then completed by a hyphen and a sequential number assigned within each section of subpart  52.2. The following example illustrates the makeup of the FAR provision or clause number (see Figure 1 below).</p><figure class="fig figborder"><img alt="Image 0" class="image" height="208" src="/sites/default/files/page_file_uploads/provision.png" width="398"/></figure><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e45"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR</em>.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL3" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e53"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Provisions or clauses that supplement the FAR are-</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e59"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Prescribed and included in authorized agency acquisition regulations issued within an agency to satisfy the specific needs of the agency as a whole;</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e64"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Prescribed and included in a regulation issued by a suborganization of an agency to satisfy the needs of that particular suborganization; or</p><p class="ListL4" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e69"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Developed for use at a suborganizational level of an agency, not meant for repetitive use, but intended to meet the needs of an individual acquisition and, thus, impractical to include in either an agency or suborganization acquisition regulation.

If, for example, an agency acquisition regulation contains only one provision followed by only one clause supplementing the FAR in its section 52.236 (Construction and Architect-Engineer Contracts), then the sequential numbers would be "70" for the provision and "71" for the clause.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e113"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Prescriptions</em>. Each provision or clause in subpart  52.2 is prescribed at that place in the FAR text where the subject matter of the provision or clause receives its primary treatment. The prescription includes all conditions, requirements, and instructions for using the provision or clause and its alternates, if any. The provision or clause may be referred to in other FAR locations.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e123"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Introductory text.</em> Within subpart  52.2, the introductory text of each provision or clause includes a cross-reference to the location in the FAR subject text that prescribes its use.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e133"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> Matrix.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_52_101__d3043e139"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The matrix in subpart  52.3 contains a column for each principal type and/or purpose of contract (<em class="ph i">e.g.,</em> fixed-price supply, cost reimbursement research and development).
