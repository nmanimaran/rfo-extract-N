<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Unless an international agreement or the WTO GPA (see 25.408(a)(4)) requires a specific currency, contracting officers must determine whether solicitations for contracts to be entered into and performed outside the United States will require submission of offers in U.S. currency or a specified foreign currency. In unusual circumstances, the contracting officer may permit submission of offers in other than a specified currency.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> To ensure a fair evaluation of offers, solicitations generally should require all offers to be priced in the same currency. However, if the solicitation permits submission of offers in other than a specified currency, the contracting officer must convert the offered prices to U.S. currency for evaluation purposes. The contracting officer must use the current market exchange rate from a commonly used source in effect as follows:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> For acquisitions conducted using sealed bidding procedures, on the date of bid opening.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> For acquisitions conducted using negotiation procedures—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> On the date specified for receipt of offers, if award is based on initial offers; otherwise</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> On the date specified for receipt of final proposal revisions.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> If a contract is priced in foreign currency, the agency must ensure that adequate funds are available to cover currency fluctuations to avoid a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act (31 U.S.C. 1341, 1342, 1511-1519).</p></div>
