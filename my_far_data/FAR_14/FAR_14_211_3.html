<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Step one</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Synopsize requests for technical proposals in accordance with Part 5. The request must include, as a minimum, the following:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> A description of the supplies or services required.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> A statement of intent to use the two-step method.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The requirements of the technical proposal.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The evaluation criteria, to include all factors and any significant subfactors.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> A statement that the technical proposals must not include prices or pricing information.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> The date, or date and hour, by which the technical proposal must be received (see 14.210).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vii)</span> A statement that, in the second step—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> The contracting officer will consider awards based upon bids that have acceptable technical proposals, either initially or as a result of discussions; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Each technical proposal must be based on the bidder's own technical proposals.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(viii)</span> A statement that—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Bidders should submit technical proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The Government may make a final determination regarding a technical proposal's acceptability solely on the basis as submitted; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> The Government may proceed with the second step without requesting further information from any bidder; however, the Government may request additional information from bidders of bids that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable and may discuss bids with their bidders.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ix)</span> A statement that a notice of unacceptability will be forwarded to the bidder upon completion of the technical proposal evaluation and final determination of unacceptability.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(x)</span> A statement either that each bidder may only submit one technical proposal or, if authorized, multiple technical proposals. When specifications permit different technical approaches, it is generally in the Government's interest to authorize multiple technical proposals. If multiple technical proposals are authorized, see 14.207(n).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Include information on delivery or performance requirements that may assist bidders in determining whether or not to submit a technical proposal. Indicate that the information is not binding on the Government and that the invitation issued under step two will include actual delivery or performance requirements.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Upon receipt, the contracting officer must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Safeguard technical proposals against disclosure to unauthorized persons;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Accept and handle data marked in accordance with part 15 and 27; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Remove any reference to price or cost.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> The contracting officer must establish a time period for evaluating technical proposals. The period may vary with the complexity and number of technical proposals involved. However, the evaluation should be completed quickly.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Base evaluations on the criteria in the request for proposals but not consideration of responsibility as defined in part 9. Categorize technical proposals as—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Acceptable;</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> Reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(C)</span> Unacceptable.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Categorize any proposal that modifies, or fails to conform to the essential requirements or specifications of, the request for technical proposals as unacceptable.</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The contracting officer may proceed directly with step two if there are sufficient acceptable proposals to ensure adequate price competition under step two, and if further time, effort and delay to make additional technical proposals acceptable and thereby increase competition would not be in Government's interest. If this is not the case, the contracting officer must request bidders whose technical proposals may be made acceptable to submit additional clarifying or supplementing information. The contracting officer must identify the nature of the deficiencies in the technical proposal or the nature of the additional information required. The contracting officer may also arrange discussions for this purpose. Do not discuss a technical proposal with any bidder other than the submitter.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> When requesting additional information, the contracting officer must establish an appropriate time for bidders to conclude discussions, if any, submit all additional information, and incorporate such additional information as part of their technical proposals. The contracting officer may extend the due date for such submissions at their discretion. If the additional information is incorporated into a technical proposal within the established time, and the contracting officer determines that the technical proposal is acceptable, the contracting officer will update its category to acceptable.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> When a technical proposal is found unacceptable (either initially or after clarification), the contracting officer must promptly notify the bidder of the basis of the determination and that a revision of the technical proposal will not be considered. Upon written request, the contracting officer must debrief unsuccessful bidders (see part 15).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(8)</span> Late technical proposals are governed by part 15.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(9)</span> If it is necessary to discontinue two-step sealed bidding, the contracting officer must include a statement of the facts and circumstances in the contract file. The contracting officer must notify each bidder in writing. When step one results in no acceptable technical proposals or only one acceptable technical proposal, the acquisition may be continued by negotiation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Step two.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Follow sealed bidding procedures except that invitations for bids in step two must—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Be issued only to those bidders that submitted acceptable technical proposals in step one;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Include the provision prescribed in 14.207(o);</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Clearly state that the bidder must comply with the specifications and the bidder's technical proposal; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Not be synopsized through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) as an acquisition opportunity nor publicly posted.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> List the names of firms that submitted acceptable proposals in step one through the GPE for the benefit of prospective subcontractors (see 5.201).</p></div>
