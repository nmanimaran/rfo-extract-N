Substantial participation requires more than official responsibility, knowledge, perfunctory involvement, or involvement on an administrative or peripheral issue. Participation may be substantial even though it is not determinative of the outcome of a particular matter. A finding of substantiality should be based not only on the effort devoted to a matter, but on the importance of the effort. While a series of peripheral involvements may be insubstantial, the single act of approving or participating in a critical step may be substantial. However, the review of procurement documents solely to determine compliance with regulatory, administrative, or budgetary procedures, does not constitute substantial participation in a procurement.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_3_104_1__d91e220"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Generally, an official will not be considered to have participated personally and substantially in a procurement solely by participating in the following activities:</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_3_104_1__d91e226"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Agency-level boards, panels, or other advisory committees that review program milestones or evaluate and recommend alternative technologies or approaches for broad agency-level missions or objectives.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_3_104_1__d91e231"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> General technical, engineering, or scientific work with broad application not directly tied to a specific procurement, even if that work later becomes part of a procurement.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_3_104_1__d91e236"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Clerical functions supporting a particular procurement.</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_3_104_1__d91e241"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> For OMB Circular A-76 procurements, participation in management studies, preparation of in-house cost estimates, preparation of "most efficient organization" analyses, or providing data or technical support for others to develop performance standards, statements of work, or specifications.</p><p class="p" id="FAR_3_104_1__d91e237"><em class="ph i _3.104-1d88e389 Term">Source selection evaluation board</em> means any board, team, council, or other group that evaluates bids or proposals.</p></div>
