<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>An official or former official of a Federal agency may request advice from the appropriate agency ethics official before accepting compensation from a contractor. This applies when the individual does not know whether 41 U.S.C. 2104 (see 3.104-3(d)) prevents them from accepting such compensation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>The request for an advisory opinion must be in writing, include all relevant information reasonably available to the official or former official, and be dated and signed. The request must include information about the—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span>Procurement(s), or decision(s) on matters under 3.104-3(d)(1)(iii), involving the particular contractor. This includes contract or solicitation numbers, dates of solicitation or award, a description of the supplies or services procured or to be procured, and contract amount;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>Individual's participation in the procurement or decision, including the dates or time periods of that participation, and the nature of the individual's duties, responsibilities, or actions; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>Contractor, including a description of the products or services produced by the division or affiliate of the contractor from whom the individual proposes to accept compensation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>The agency ethics official should issue an opinion within 30 days after receiving a complete request, or as soon as practicable after that. The opinion should address whether the proposed conduct would violate 41 U.S.C. 2104.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> If the request does not include complete information, the agency ethics official may ask the requester to provide more information. The ethics official may also request information from other persons, including the source selection authority, the contracting officer, or the requester's immediate supervisor.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span>When issuing an opinion, the agency ethics official may rely on the accuracy of information provided by the requester or other agency sources. This applies unless the official has reason to believe the information is fraudulent, misleading, or otherwise incorrect.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span>If the requester receives a written opinion from the agency ethics official stating they may accept compensation from a particular contractor and accepts such compensation in good faith reliance on that opinion, neither the requester nor the contractor will be found to have knowingly violated 41 U.S.C. 2104. However, if the requester or contractor has actual knowledge or reason to believe the opinion is based on fraudulent, misleading, or otherwise incorrect information, their reliance on the opinion will not be considered good faith.</p></div>
