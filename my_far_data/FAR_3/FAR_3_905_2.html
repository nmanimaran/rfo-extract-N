<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a) </span>When a contractor or subcontractor fails to comply with an order issued under 3.905-1(a)(2), the head of the agency concerned must file an action to enforce the order in the U.S. district court for the district where the reprisal occurred. In any action brought under this authority, the court may grant appropriate relief, including injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and attorney fees and costs. The complainant employee upon whose behalf an order was issued may also file such an action or join an action filed by the head of the agency.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b) </span>Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order issued under 3.905-1(a)(2) may seek review of the order's compliance with 41 U.S.C. 4712 and its implementing regulations in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit where the reprisal is alleged to have occurred. The petition for review must be filed within 60 days after the head of the agency issues the order. Filing such an appeal does not stop enforcement of the agency head's order unless the court specifically grants a stay.</p></div>
