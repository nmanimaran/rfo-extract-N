<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">Government business must be conducted in a manner above reproach. Except as authorized by statute or regulation, business must be conducted with complete impartiality and without preferential treatment for anyone. Transactions involving public funds require the highest degree of public trust and impeccable standards of conduct. The general rule is to avoid any conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest in Government-contractor relationships. Many Federal laws restrict Government personnel actions. Beyond these restrictions, official conduct must meet a standard where personnel would have no reluctance to fully disclose their actions to the public.</p></div>
