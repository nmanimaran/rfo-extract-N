<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> An acquisition may be either fully or partially covered by a waiver. Partial waiver coverage occurs when only portions of the products or services being procured or provided by a source are covered by an applicable waiver. If the requiring activity notifies the contracting officer that the acquisition is partially covered by an approved individual waiver or class waiver, then the contracting officer must work with the program office or requiring activity to identify in the solicitation, request for quotation, or order the products or services that are subject to the waiver.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contracting officer, in accordance with agency procedures, must decide whether to pursue a waiver or to make award to an offeror that does not require a waiver. If a full or partial waiver is being pursued, then the contracting officer may not make an award until written approval is obtained that the waiver has been granted.</p></div>
