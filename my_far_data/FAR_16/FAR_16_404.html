Two forms of fixed-price incentive contracts, firm target and successive targets, are further described in 16.404-1 and 16.404-2.</p><p class="ListL1">(b) <em class="ph i">Application</em>. A fixed-price incentive contract is appropriate when-</p><p class="ListL2">(1) A firm-fixed-price contract is not suitable;</p><p class="ListL2">(2) The contractor’s acceptance of a degree of cost responsibility will provide a positive profit incentive to control costs and increase performance; and</p><p class="ListL2">(3) If the contract also includes technical, performance or delivery incentives, the technical/performance/delivery incentives should provide opportunities for the incentives to improve the contractor’s management of the work.</p><p class="ListL1">(c) <em class="ph i">Billing prices</em>. In fixed-price incentive contracts, interim billing prices are established for payment. Billing prices may be adjusted, within the ceiling limit, when requested by either party to the contract, when it becomes apparent that final price will be substantially different from the target price.</p></div>
