                <h2>16.405Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">The cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a cost-reimbursement contract that adjusts the initially negotiated fee based on a formula comparing total allowable costs to total target costs. This contract type includes a target cost, target fee, minimum and maximum fees, and a fee adjustment formula. After contract performance, the contractor’s fee is determined using the specified fee formula. The formula allows for fee increases above the target fee when total allowable costs are less than target costs, and fee decreases below the target fee when total allowable costs exceed target costs, creating an incentive for effective contract management. When total allowable costs fall outside the range of the fee formula, the contractor receives total allowable costs plus either the minimum or maximum fee.</p></div>
