Due to the connection of cost, technical performance, and delivery goals, a contract that focuses on only one of the goals may jeopardize control over the others. All multiple-incentive contracts must include a cost incentive (or constraint) that prevents rewarding a contractor for greater technical performance or delivery results when the cost of those results outweighs their value to the Government.</p></div>
