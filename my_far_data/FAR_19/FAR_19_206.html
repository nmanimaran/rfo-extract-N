Master subcontracting plans shall be effective for a 3-year period after approval by the contracting officer; however, it is incumbent upon contractors to maintain and update master subcontracting plans. Changes required to update master subcontracting plans are not effective until approved by the contracting officer. A master subcontracting plan, when incorporated in an individual plan, shall apply to that contract throughout the life of the contract.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> An individual subcontracting plan contains all the elements required by the clause at 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan, and separate statements and goals based on total subcontract dollars for the basic contract and for each option.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> A commercial subcontracting plan is the preferred type of subcontracting plan for contractors furnishing commercial products and commercial services.

Once a contractor's commercial plan has been approved, the Government must not require another subcontracting plan from the same contractor while the plan remains in effect, as long as the product or service being provided by the contractor continues to meet the definition of a commercial product or commercial service. The contractor shall—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Submit the commercial plan to either the first contracting officer awarding a contract subject to the plan during the contractor's fiscal year, or, if the contractor has ongoing contracts with commercial plans, to the contracting officer responsible for the contract with the latest completion date. The contracting officer must negotiate the commercial plan for the Government. The approved commercial plan shall remain in effect during the contractor's fiscal year for all Government contracts in effect during that period;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Submit a new commercial plan, 30 working days before the end of the Contractor's fiscal year, to the contracting officer responsible for the uncompleted Government contract with the latest completion date.
