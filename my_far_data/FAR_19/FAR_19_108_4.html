<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Agency evaluation</em>. In determining the extent to which a requirement should be offered in support of the 8(a) program, the agency should evaluate—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Current and future plans to acquire the specific items or work that 8(a) participants are seeking to provide, identified in terms of—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Estimated quantities of the supplies or services required or the estimated number of construction projects planned;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Length of contract, including option periods (see 19.303-1(d)); and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Performance or delivery requirements, including—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Required monthly production rates, when applicable; and</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> For construction, the geographical location where work is to be performed;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The impact of any delay in delivery;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Whether the items or work have previously been acquired using small business set-asides, and the date the items or work were acquired;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Problems encountered in previous acquisitions of the items or work from the 8(a) participants or other contractors; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Any other pertinent information about known 8(a) participants, the items, or the work. This includes any information concerning the participants' products or capabilities. When necessary, the contracting agency must make an independent review of the factors in 19.108-3(a) and other aspects of the participants' capabilities which would ensure the satisfactory performance of the requirement being considered for commitment to the 8(a) program.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Agency offering</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> After completing its evaluation, the contracting office must notify the SBA of the extent of its plans to place 8(a) contracts with the SBA for specific quantities of items or work. The notification, referred to as an offering letter, must identify the time frames within which resulting 8(a) awards must be completed in order for the agency to meet its responsibilities. The offering letter must also contain the following information applicable to each prospective contract:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> A description of the work to be performed or items to be delivered, and a copy of the statement of work, if available.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The estimated period of performance.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The NAICS code that applies to the principal nature of the acquisition.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The anticipated dollar value of the requirement, including options, if any.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Any special restrictions or geographical limitations on the requirement (for construction, include the location of the work to be performed).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vi)</span> Any special capabilities or disciplines needed for contract performance.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(vii)</span> The type of contract anticipated. In accordance with 8.104, use of existing government-wide contracts is required in certain instances.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(viii)</span> The acquisition history, if any, of the requirement, including the names and addresses of any small business contractors that have performed this requirement during the previous 24 months.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ix)</span> A statement that prior to the offering no solicitation for the specific acquisition has been issued as a small business, HUBZone, service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside, or a set-aside under the Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program, and that no other public communication (such as a notice through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE)) has been made showing the contracting agency's clear intention to set-aside the acquisition for small business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, or a set-aside under the WOSB Program.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(x)</span> Identification of any particular 8(a) participant designated for consideration, including a brief justification, such as—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> The 8(a) participant, through its own efforts, marketed the requirement and caused it to be reserved for the 8(a) program; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The acquisition is a follow-on or renewal contract and the nominated 8(a) participant is the incumbent.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(xi)</span> Bonding requirements, if applicable.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(xii)</span> Identification of all 8(a) participants which have expressed an interest in being considered for the acquisition. This should include a list of all 8(a) contract-holders on an existing government-wide contract that is planned to be used to fill the requirement (see 8.104).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(xiii)</span> Identification of all SBA field offices that have asked for the acquisition for the 8(a) program.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(xiv)</span> A request, if appropriate, that a requirement with an estimated contract value under the applicable competitive threshold be awarded as an 8(a) competitive contract (see 19.108-7(d)). SBA has already authorized certain government-wide contracts (e.g. Federal Supply Schedule) to allow competition amongst the 8(a) contract-holders at any dollar value. To determine whether SBA has provided this authority for the contract planned to be used, refer to the ordering procedures for that contract.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(xv)</span> A request, if appropriate, that a requirement with a contract value over the applicable competitive threshold be awarded as a sole source contract (see 19.108-7(b)).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(xvi)</span> Any other pertinent and reasonably available data.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> An agency offering a construction requirement for which no specific offeror is nominated should submit it to the SBA District Office for the geographical area where the work is to be performed.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> An agency offering a construction requirement on behalf of a specific offeror should submit it to the SBA District Office servicing that concern.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Sole source requirements, other than construction, should be forwarded directly to the district office that services the nominated 8(a) participant. If the contracting officer is not nominating a specific 8(a) participant, the offering letter should be forwarded to the district office servicing the geographical area in which the contracting office is located.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> All requirements for 8(a) competition, other than construction, should be forwarded to the district office servicing the geographical area in which the contracting office is located. All requirements for 8(a) construction competition should be forwarded to the district office servicing the geographical area in which all or the major portion of the construction is to be performed. All requirements, including construction, must be synopsized through the GPE. For construction, the synopsis must include the geographical area of the competition set forth in the SBA's acceptance letter.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">SBA acceptance</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Upon receipt of the contracting office's offering letter, SBA will determine whether to accept the requirement for the 8(a) program. SBA's decision whether to accept the requirement will be transmitted to the contracting office in writing within 10 working days of receipt of the offer if the contract is likely to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and within two working days of receipt if the contract is at or below the simplified acquisition threshold. The contracting office may grant an extension of these time periods, if requested by SBA.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> For acquisitions exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, if SBA does not respond to an offering letter within ten working days, the contracting office may seek SBA's acceptance through the Associate Administrator for Business Development. The contracting office may assume that SBA has accepted the requirement into the 8(a) program if it does not receive a reply from the Associate Administrator for Business Development within five calendar days of receipt of the contracting office's request.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> For acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, when the contracting office makes an offer to the 8(a) program on behalf of a specific 8(a) participant and does not receive a reply to its offering letter within two working days, the contracting office may assume the offer is accepted and proceed with award of an 8(a) contract.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> As part of the acceptance process, SBA will review the appropriateness of the NAICS code designation assigned to the requirement by the contracting officer.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> SBA will not challenge the NAICS code assigned to the requirement by the contracting officer if it is reasonable, even though other NAICS codes may also be reasonable.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> If SBA and the contracting officer are unable to agree on a NAICS code designation for the requirement, SBA may refuse to accept the requirement for the 8(a) program, appeal the contracting officer's determination to the head of the agency pursuant to 19.108-9, or appeal the NAICS code designation to the SBA Office of Hearings and Appeals under subpart C of 13 CFR part 134.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> For sole source 8(a) awards, if an appropriate match exists, SBA will advise the contracting officer whether it will participate in contract negotiations or whether SBA will authorize the contracting officer to negotiate directly with the identified 8(a) participant. Where SBA has delegated its contract execution functions to a contracting agency, SBA will also identify that delegation in its acceptance letter. For a joint venture, SBA will determine eligibility as part of its acceptance of a sole-source requirement and will approve the joint venture agreement prior to award in accordance with 13 CFR 124.513(e).</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> <em class="ph i">Sole source award where the contracting officer nominates a specific 8(a) participant.</em> SBA will determine whether an appropriate match exists where the contracting officer identifies a particular participant for a sole source award.</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Once SBA determines that a procurement is suitable to be accepted as an 8(a) sole source contract, SBA will normally accept it on behalf of the 8(a) participant recommended by the contracting officer, provided that the 8(a) participant complies with the requirements of 13 CFR 124.503(c)(1).</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> If an appropriate match does not exist, SBA will notify the 8(a) participant and the contracting officer, and may then nominate an alternate 8(a) participant.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> <em class="ph i">Sole source award where the contracting officer does not nominate a specific 8(a) participant.</em> When a contracting officer does not nominate an 8(a) participant for performance of a sole source 8(a) contract, SBA will select an 8(a) participant for possible award from among two or more eligible and qualified 8(a) participants. The selection will be based upon relevant factors, including business development needs, compliance with competitive business mix requirements (if applicable), financial condition, management ability, technical capability, and whether award will promote the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts. (For construction requirements see 13 CFR 124.503(d)(1)).</p></div>
