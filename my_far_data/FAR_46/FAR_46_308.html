<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_46_308__d2696e8">The contracting officer must insert the clause at 52.246-8, Inspection of Research and Development-Cost-Reimbursement, in solicitations and contracts for research and development when (a) the primary objective of the contract is the delivery of end items other than designs, drawings, or reports, and (b)a cost-reimbursement contract is contemplated; unless use of the clause is impractical and the clause prescribed in 46.309 is considered to be more appropriate. If it is contemplated that the contract will be on a no-fee basis, the contracting officer must use the clause with its AlternateI.</p></div>
