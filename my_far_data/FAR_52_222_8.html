Contractors employing apprentices or trainees under approved programs must maintain written evidence of the registration of apprenticeship programs and certification of trainee programs, the registration of the apprentices and trainees, and the ratios and wage rates prescribed in the applicable programs.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_52_222_8__d3316e30"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_52_222_8__d3316e35"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The Contractor must submit weekly for each week in which any contract work is performed a copy of all payrolls to the Contracting Officer. The payrolls submitted must set out accurately and completely all of the information required to be maintained under paragraph (a) of this clause, except that full social security numbers and home addresses must not be included on weekly transmittals. Instead the payrolls must only need to include an individually identifying number for each employee (e.g., the last four digits of the employee’s social security number).

If the Contractor or subcontractor fails to submit required records or to make them available, the Contracting Officer may, after written notice to the Contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment. Furthermore, failure to submit the required records upon request or to make such records available may be grounds for debarment action pursuant to <span class="ph CFR">29 CFR 5.12</span>.</p><p class="p Endofclause">(End of clause)</p></div>
