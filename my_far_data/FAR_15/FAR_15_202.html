                <h2>15.202Evaluating competitive proposals.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Proposal evaluation is an assessment of the proposal and an offeror's ability to perform the prospective contract successfully. Agencies must evaluate each competitive proposal based solely on the factors and subfactors in the RFP.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">Clarifications</em>.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Clarifications are exchanges between the Government and offerors where offerors are given the opportunity to resolve minor or clerical errors or clarify certain aspects of their proposal. Clarifications can be used to enhance the Government’s understanding of a proposal, allow reasonable interpretation of a proposal, or facilitate the Government’s evaluation process.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Clarifications include, but are not limited to, addressing: ambiguities of the proposal; other concerns such as perceived deficiencies, weaknesses, errors, omissions, or mistakes; the relevance of an offeror's past performance information; and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Clarifications do not permit offerors to revise their proposal and cannot be used to cure proposal deficiencies or material omissions or materially alter the technical or cost elements of the proposal. However, contracting officers may request additional information or documentation provided the cost/price or other material elements of the proposal are unchanged.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Clarifications may occur, at the contracting officer’s discretion, at any time after receipt of proposals through contract award. Contracting officers are not required to conduct clarifications with an offeror. If the contracting officer conducts clarifications with one or more offerors, it is not required to conduct clarifications with any other offeror.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Oral Presentations</em>. Contracting officers must maintain a record of oral presentations to document what the Government relied upon in making the source selection decision. The method and level of detail of the record (e.g., videotaping, audio tape recording, written record, Government notes, copies of offeror briefing slides or presentation notes) is at the discretion of the SSA. When an oral presentation includes information that the parties intend to include in the contract as material terms or conditions, the information must be put in writing and incorporated in the proposal and any resultant contract. Incorporation by reference of oral statements is not permitted.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Technical evaluation.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> When using the lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) approach, proposals are evaluated for technical acceptability only.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> When using the tradeoff approach, the evaluation must include-</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> An assessment of each offeror's ability to accomplish the technical requirements; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> An evaluation of the relative strengths, deficiencies, significant weaknesses, and risks supporting proposal evaluation.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If teleworking is not prohibited, agencies must not unfavorably evaluate an offer that includes telework unless the contracting officer executes a written determination in accordance with part 7.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Past performance evaluation.</em></p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> <em class="ph i">No past performance information.</em> An offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> <em class="ph i">LPTA source selection process</em>. If past performance is evaluated when using the LPTA source selection process, contracting officers must only determine if the performance is technically acceptable and not perform a comparative assessment of the information.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> <em class="ph i">Considerations</em>. Evaluations should consider the following:</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The information provided by the offeror, as well as information obtained from any other sources.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in contractor's performance. The SSA determines the relevance of similar past performance information.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Any information regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or subcontractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement when such information is relevant to the instant acquisition.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The past performance of the joint venture, when evaluating an offer from a joint venture. If the joint venture does not demonstrate past performance for award, the past performance of each party to the joint venture must be considered.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> <em class="ph i">Small business</em>. When using the LPTA source selection approach and a small business would have been in contention for award, but their past performance is determined to be unacceptable, the matter must be referred to the SBA for a Certificate of Competency determination.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Cost or price evaluation</em>. Agencies must purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. Contracting officers are responsible for evaluating and documenting the reasonableness of the awarded price in accordance with subpart 15.4.</p></div>
