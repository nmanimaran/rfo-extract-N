<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Cognizant audit activities, when appropriate, must establish and manage regular programs for reviewing selected contractors' estimating systems or methods, in order to reduce the scope of reviews to be performed on individual proposals, expedite the negotiation process, and increase the reliability of proposals. The results of estimating system reviews must be documented in survey reports.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Auditors must send a copy of the estimating system survey report and a copy of the official notice of corrective action required to each contracting office and contract administration office having substantial business with that contractor. Significant deficiencies not corrected by the contractor must be considered in subsequent proposal analyses and negotiations.</p></div>
