<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Order of preference</em>. For acquisitions that do not require certified cost or pricing data, contracting officers must generally use the following order of preference to determine the type of data to require:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> No additional data from the offeror, when adequate price competition exists (see 15.403-2);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Data related to prices (e.g., established catalog or market prices, sales to non-governmental and governmental entities), relying first on—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Data available within the Government; then</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Data obtained from sources other than the offeror; and then, if necessary,</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Data obtained from the offeror; then,</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Cost data to the extent necessary for the contracting officer to determine a fair and reasonable price.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Requirement</em>.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Contracting officers must require submission of data other than certified cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to determine a fair and reasonable price (10 U.S.C. 3705(a) and 41 U.S.C. 3505(a)). At a minimum, the data must include appropriate data on the prices at which the same item or similar items have previously been sold, adequate for determining the reasonableness of the price. This data is not required when price reasonableness is established through adequate price competition or prices set by law or regulation, unless paragraph (e) of this subsection applies.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Contracting officers may require data other than certified cost or pricing data to determine the cost realism of competing offers or to evaluate competing approaches.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Data Requests</em>. When requesting data, contracting officers—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Must use the contractor's format for data submission, but see 15.105-4(b)(2);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Must ensure that data used to support price negotiations are sufficiently current to permit negotiation of a fair and reasonable price; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Should limit requests for updated data to the data that affect the adequacy of the proposal for negotiations (e.g., changes in price lists).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Refusals to submit data</em>. As specified in section 808 of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1999 (Pub. L. 105-261), an offeror who does not comply with a requirement to submit data for a contract or subcontract in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this subsection is ineligible for award unless the head of the contracting activity (HCA) determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to make the award to that offeror, based on consideration of the following:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The effort made to obtain the data.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The need for the item or service.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Increased cost or significant harm to the Government if award is not made.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Data when adequate price competition exists</em>. If adequate price competition exists, but there are unusual circumstances in which additional data are necessary to determine the reasonableness of price, contracting officers must obtain the additional data from sources other than the offeror, to the maximum extent practicable. In addition, contracting officers should request data to determine the cost realism of competing offers or to evaluate competing approaches.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> <em class="ph i">Data for commercial products and commercial services</em>. When acquiring a commercial product or commercial service, contracting officers must—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Use price analysis to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Require the offeror to submit data other than certified cost or pricing data when the contracting officer is unable to determine a price fair and reasonable after obtaining data from sources other than the offeror. This data may include history of sales to non-governmental and governmental entities, cost data, or any other information the contracting officer requires;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Limit requests for sales data to data for the same or similar items during a relevant time period;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> To the maximum extent practicable, request data in the format regularly maintained by the offeror as part of its commercial operations;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Not disclose outside the Government data obtained relating to commercial products or commercial services that is exempt from disclosure under part 24 or the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)); and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> For services that are not offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, but are of a type offered and sold competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace, see 15.403-2(c)(3)(ii).</p></div>
