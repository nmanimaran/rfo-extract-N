<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">General</em>. Cost analysis is the review and evaluation of any separate cost elements and profit or fee in an offeror's or contractor's proposal, as needed to determine a fair and reasonable price or to determine cost realism, and the application of judgment to determine how well the proposed costs represent what the cost of the contract should be, assuming reasonable economy and efficiency.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Techniques</em>. The Government may use various cost analysis techniques and procedures to ensure a fair and reasonable price, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Verification of cost data or pricing data and evaluation of cost elements, including—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The necessity for, and reasonableness of, proposed costs, including allowances for contingencies;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Projection of the offeror's cost trends, on the basis of current and historical cost or pricing data;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Reasonableness of estimates generated by appropriately calibrated and validated parametric models or cost-estimating relationships; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The application of audited or negotiated indirect cost rates, labor rates, and cost of money or other factors.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Evaluating the effect of the offeror's current practices on future costs. In conducting this evaluation, contracting officers must ensure that the effects of inefficient or uneconomical past practices are not projected into the future. In pricing production of recently developed complex equipment, contracting officers should perform a trend analysis of basic labor and materials, even in periods of relative price stability.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Comparison of costs proposed by the offeror for individual cost elements with—</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Actual costs previously incurred by the same offeror;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Previous cost estimates from the offeror or from other offerors for the same or similar items;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Other cost estimates received in response to the Government's request;</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Independent Government cost estimates by technical personnel; and</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Forecasts of planned expenditures.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Verification that the offeror's cost submissions are in accordance with the contract cost principles and procedures in part 31 and, when applicable, the requirements and procedures in 48 CFR chapter 99.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Review to determine whether any cost data or pricing data, necessary to make the offeror's proposal suitable for negotiation, have not been either submitted or identified in writing by the offeror. If there are such data, contracting officers must attempt to obtain and use them in the negotiations or make satisfactory allowance for the incomplete data.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Analysis of the results of any make-or-buy program reviews, in evaluating subcontract costs.</p></div>
