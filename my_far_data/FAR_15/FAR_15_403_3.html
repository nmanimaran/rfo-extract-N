<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> <em class="ph i">Threshold</em>. Unless an exception at 15.403-2 applies, contracting officers must obtain certified cost or pricing data when an action meets or exceeds the threshold of $2.5 million (for prime contracts awarded on or after July 1, 2018). The threshold is $950,000 for prime contracts awarded prior to July 1, 2018, unless otherwise stated in the contract. Contracting officers should consider requesting a waiver when the standards at 15.403-2(c)(4) can be met.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Actions requiring certified cost or pricing data</em>. Certified cost or pricing data are required before completing any of the following actions expected to exceed the current threshold or, in the case of existing contracts, the threshold specified in the existing contract:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The award of any negotiated contract (except for undefinitized actions such as letter contracts).</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The award of a subcontract at any tier, if the contractor and each higher-tier subcontractor were required to furnish certified cost or pricing data.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The modification of any sealed bid or negotiated contract (whether or not certified cost or pricing data were initially required) or any subcontract covered by paragraph (b)(2) of this subsection.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Price adjustment amounts must consider both increases and decreases (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, a $500,000 modification resulting from a reduction of $1,500,000 and an increase of $1,000,000 is a $2,500,000 pricing adjustment exceeding the $2,500,000 threshold). This requirement does not apply when unrelated and separately priced changes for which certified cost or pricing data would not otherwise be required are included for administrative convenience in the same modification.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Negotiated final pricing actions (<em class="ph i">e.g.</em>, termination settlements and total final price agreements for fixed-price incentive and redeterminable contracts) are contract modifications requiring certified cost or pricing data if—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> The total final price agreement for such settlements or agreements exceeds the pertinent threshold set forth at paragraph (a) of this subsection; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> The partial termination settlement plus the estimate to complete the continued portion of the contract exceeds the pertinent threshold set forth at paragraph (a) of this subsection.</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Certified cost or pricing data are not required for modifications—</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(A)</span> Solely for overrun funding or interim billing price adjustments; or</p><p class="ListL4"><span class="ph autonumber">(B)</span> To exercise an option at the price established at contract award or initial negotiation.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Required documentation from offerors</em>. When certified cost or pricing data are required, contracting officers must require the contractor or prospective contractor to submit to the contracting officer (and to have any subcontractor or prospective subcontractor submit to the prime contractor or appropriate subcontractor tier) the following in support of any proposal:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The certified cost or pricing data and data other than certified cost or pricing data required by the contracting officer to determine that the price is fair and reasonable.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> A <em class="ph i">Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data</em>, in the format specified in 15.403-4, certifying that to the best of its knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data were accurate, complete, and current as of the date of agreement on price or, if applicable, an earlier date agreed upon between the parties that is as close as practicable to the date of agreement on price.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Inflation adjustments</em>. When a clause refers to the certified cost or pricing threshold and the threshold is adjusted for inflation pursuant to part 1, the changed threshold applies throughout the remaining term of the contract, unless there is another threshold adjustment.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Requests for certified data below the threshold</em>. Unless prohibited because an exception at 15.403-2 applies, the HCA without power of delegation, may authorize the contracting officer to obtain certified cost or pricing data for pricing actions below the pertinent threshold in paragraph (a) of this subsection, provided the action exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. The HCA must justify the requirement for certified cost or pricing data and provide a written finding that certified cost or pricing data are necessary to determine whether the price is fair and reasonable and the facts supporting that finding.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> <em class="ph i">Delayed exception</em>. If certified cost or pricing data are requested and submitted by an offeror, but an exception is later found to apply, the data must not be considered certified cost or pricing data and must not be certified in accordance with 15.403-4.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> <em class="ph i">Foreign governments</em>. The requirements of this subsection also apply to contracts entered into by an agency on behalf of a foreign government.</p></div>
