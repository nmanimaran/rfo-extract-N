However, such costs may be borne only upon a determination in accordance with agency procedures that such additional qualified sources or products are likely to result in cost savings from increased competition for future requirements sufficient to amortize the costs incurred by the agency within a reasonable period, considering the duration and dollar value of anticipated future requirements. A prospective contractor requesting the United States to bear testing and evaluation costs must certify as to its status as a small business concern under section 3 of the Small Business Act in order to receive further consideration.</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_9_204__d585e28"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <em class="ph i">Other responsibilities when establishing qualification requirements.</em></p><p class="RuninChild ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Qualifying products that meet specification requirements.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_204__d585e33"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Listing manufacturers and suppliers whose products are qualified in accordance with agency procedures.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_204__d585e38"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Furnishing QPL's, OML's, or QBL's or the qualification requirements themselves to prospective offerors and the public upon request (see 9.202(a)(2)(i)).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_204__d585e46"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Clarifying, as necessary, qualification requirements.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_204__d585e51"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> In appropriate cases, when requested by the contracting officer, providing concurrence in a decision not to enforce a qualification requirement for a solicitation.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_204__d585e56"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Withdrawing or omitting qualification of a listed product, manufacturer or offeror, as necessary.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_204__d585e61"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Advising persons that furnished any list of products, manufacturers or offerors meeting a qualification requirement and suppliers whose products are on any such list that—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_204__d585e67"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The list does not constitute endorsement of the product, manufacturer, or other source by the Government;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_204__d585e72"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> The products or sources listed have been qualified under the latest applicable specification;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_204__d585e77"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> The list may be amended without notice;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_204__d585e82"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> The listing of a product or source does not release the supplier from compliance with the specification; and</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_9_204__d585e87"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Use of the list for advertising or publicity is permitted.
