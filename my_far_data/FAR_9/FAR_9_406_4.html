However, a debarment may not be extended solely on the basis of the facts and circumstances upon which the initial debarment action was based. Debarments under 9.406-2(b)(2) may be extended for additional periods of one year if the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General determines that the contractor continues to be in violation of the employment provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Upon determining that debarment for an additional period is necessary, the suspension and debarring official must follow the procedures in 9.406-3 to extend the debarment.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_9_406_4__d616e64"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>The suspending and debarring official may reduce the period or extent of debarment, upon the contractor's request, supported by documentation, for reasons such as—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_406_4__d616e70"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Newly discovered material evidence;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_406_4__d616e75"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Reversal of the conviction or civil judgment upon which the debarment was based;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_406_4__d616e80"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Bona fide change in ownership or management;</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_406_4__d616e85"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Elimination of other causes for which the debarment was imposed; or</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_9_406_4__d616e90"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Other reasons the suspending and debarring official deems appropriate.</p></div>
