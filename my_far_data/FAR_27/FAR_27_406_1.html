Further, and to the extent feasible, in major system acquisitions, state data requirements as separate line items. In establishing the contract data requirements and in specifying data items for delivery under the contract, agencies may develop their own contract schedule provisions. Agency procedures may, among other things, provide for listing, specifying, identifying source, assuring delivery, and handling any data required to be delivered, first produced, or specifically used in the performance of the contract.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_406_1__d1789e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> [Reserved]</p></div>
