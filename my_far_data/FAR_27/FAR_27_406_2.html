<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_406_2__d1790e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> In some situations, such as experimental, developmental, research, or demonstration contracts, ascertaining all data requirements at contract award might be unfeasible. Use the clause at 52.227-16, Additional Data Requirements, as necessary to enable subsequent ordering of additional data first produced or specifically used in the performance of these contracts as the actual requirements become known. Normally use the clause in solicitations and contracts involving experimental, developmental, research or demonstration work (other than basic or applied research to be performed under a contract solely by a university or college when the contract amount will be $500,000 or less) unless all the requirements for data are believed known at the time of contracting and the contract specifies them. If the contract is for basic or applied research to be performed by a university or college, and the contracting officer believes the contract effort will in the future exceed $500,000, even though the initial award does not, include as necessary the clause in the initial award.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_406_2__d1790e18"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The clause at 52.227-16 allows ordering data at any time during contract performance or within a period of 3 years after acceptance of all items to be delivered under the contract. Compensate the contractor for converting the data into the prescribed form, for reproduction, or for delivery. To minimize storage costs for the retention of data, the relieve as necessary the contractor of the retention requirements for specified data items at any time during the retention period required by the clause. Permit as necessary the contractor to identify and specify in the contract data not to be ordered for delivery under the clause if the data is not necessary to meet the Government's requirements for data. Also, alter as necessary the clause by deleting the term “or specifically used” in paragraph (a) of the clause if delivery of the data is unnecessary to meet the Government's data requirements. Any data ordered under this clause will be subject to the clause at 52.227-14, Rights in Data—General, (or other equivalent clause setting forth the respective rights of the Government and the contractor) in the contract. Data authorized to be withheld under such clause will not be required to be delivered under the clause at 52.227-16, except as provided in Alternate II or Alternate III, if included (see 27.404-2(c) and (d)).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_27_406_2__d1790e35"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Absent an established program for dissemination of computer software, agencies should not order additional computer software under the clause at 52.227-16 for the sole purpose of disseminating or marketing the software to the public. In ordering software for internal purposes, consider, consistent with the Government's needs, not ordering particular source codes, algorithms, processes, formulas, or flow charts of the software where the contractor shows that these aid its efforts to disseminate or market the software.</p></div>
