<div class="body conbody"><p class="p" id="FAR_27_405_2__d1792e8">For contracts exclusively for the acquisition of existing works (without modification), such as motion pictures, television recordings, and other audiovisual works; sound recordings; musical, dramatic, and literary works; pantomimes and choreographic works; pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and works of a similar nature, the contract must specifically address the Government's rights to use, disclose, modify, distribute, and reproduce the existing works. Agencies are authorized to specially negotiate rights in existing works. This includes limitations consistent with the purposes for which the government seeks to acquire the contract. Examples of these limitations include means of exhibition or transmission, time, type of audience, and geographical location. However, if the contract requires that works of the type indicated in this paragraph are to be modified through editing, translation, or addition of subject matter, etc. (rather than purchased in existing form), then see 27.405-1.</p></div>
