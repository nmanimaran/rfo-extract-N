However, contractors are normally authorized, without such prior permission, to assert copyright in technical or scientific articles based on or containing such data that is published in academic, technical or professional journals, symposia proceedings and similar works.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e21"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The contractor must make a written request to the contracting officer for permission to assert its copyright in works containing data first produced under the contract. In its request, the contractor should identify the data involved or furnish copies of the data for which permission is requested, as well as a statement as to the intended publication or dissemination media or other purpose for which the permission is requested. Generally, grant the contractor's request when copyright protection will enhance the appropriate dissemination or use of the data unless the—</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e27"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Data consist of a report that represents the official views of the agency or that the agency is required by statute to prepare;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e32"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Government intends primarily to use the data internally;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e37"><span class="ph autonumber">(iii)</span> Data are of the type that the agency itself distributes to the public under an agency program;</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e42"><span class="ph autonumber">(iv)</span> Government determines that limitation on distribution of the data is in the national interest; or</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e47"><span class="ph autonumber">(v)</span> Government determines that the data should be disseminated without restriction.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e52"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Alternate IV of the clause at 52.227-14 provides a substitute paragraph (c)(1) granting permission for contractors to assert copyright in any data first produced in the performance of the contract without the need for any further requests. Except for contracts for management or operation of Government facilities, and contracts and subcontracts in support of programs conducted at those facilities, or where international agreements require otherwise, use Alternate IV in all contracts for basic or applied research performed solely by colleges and universities. Do not use Alternate IV in contracts with colleges and universities if a purpose of the contract is development of computer software for distribution to the public (including use in solicitations) by or on behalf of the Government. In addition, use Alternate IV in other contracts, as needed, if an agency determines that further permission to assert copyright in data first produced in performance of the contract is unnecessary. Exclude, as necessary, any data, or items or categories of data, from the provisions of Alternate IV expressly in the contract or otherwise add a paragraph (d)(4) to the clause, consistent with 27.404-4(b).</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e63"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of the clause at 52.227-14, the contractor grants the Government a paid-up nonexclusive, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute to the public, perform publicly and display publicly by or on behalf of the Government, for all data (other than computer software) first produced in the performance of a contract. For computer software, the scope of the Government's license includes all the above rights except the right to distribute to the public. Agencies may also obtain a license of different scope if the contracting officer determines, after consulting with legal counsel, such a license will substantially enhance the dissemination of any data first produced under the contract or if such a license is required to comply with international agreements. If an agency obtains a different license, the contractor must clearly state the scope of that license in a conspicuous place on the medium on which the data is recorded. For example, if the data is delivered as a report, the cover, or first page, of the report must state the terms of the license.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e71"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> The clause requires the contractor to affix the applicable copyright notices of 17 U.S .C. 401 or 4 02, and acknowledgment of Government sponsorship, (including the contract number) to data when it asserts copyright in data. Failure to do so could result in such data being treated as unlimited rights data (see 27.404-5(b)).</p><p class="p"> </p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e85"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Data not first produced in the performance of a contract.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e91"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Contractors must not deliver any data that is not first produced under the contract without either-</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e97"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> Acquiring for or granting to the Government a copyright license for the data; or</p><p class="ListL3" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e102"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Obtaining permission from the contracting officer to do otherwise.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_27_404_3__d1779e107"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The copyright license the Government acquires for such data will normally be of the same scope as discussed in paragraph (a)(4) of this subsection, and paragraph (c)(2) of the clause at 52.227-14 sets forth the license. However, agencies may obtain a license of different scope if the agency determines, after consultation with legal counsel, that such different license will accord with the purpose of acquiring the data. Both the contract and the data when delivered to the Government must clearly state that a license of a different scope applies. If the contractor delivers computer software not first produced under the contract, the contractor must grant the Government the license set forth in paragraph (g)(4) of Alternate III if included in the clause at 52.227-14, or a license agreed to in a collateral agreement made part of the contract.</p></div>
