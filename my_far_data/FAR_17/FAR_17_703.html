Due to program requirements and the unusual or unique nature of work performed under these contracts, the Government often has limited ability to create competition or replace a contractor. Therefore, contracting officers must take extraordinary steps before award to ensure that—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The prospective contractor has sufficient technical and managerial capacity,</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Organizational conflicts of interest are adequately addressed; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The contract gives the Government broad and continuing rights to involve itself in technical and managerial decision making about performance, when necessary.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_703__d1106e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The contracting officer must review each management and operating contract, following agency procedures, at appropriate intervals and at least once every 5 years.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The review should determine if meaningful improvement in performance or cost might reasonably be achieved.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any extension or renewal of a management and operating contract must be authorized at a level within the agency no lower than the level at which the original contract was authorized under 17.702-1.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_17_703__d1106e23"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Replacing an incumbent contractor is usually based largely on expectations of meaningful improvement in performance or cost.
