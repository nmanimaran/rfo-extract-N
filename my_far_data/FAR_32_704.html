Since a contractor is not obligated to incur costs in excess of the estimated cost in the contract, the contracting officer must ensure availability of funds for directed actions. The contracting officer may direct that any increase in the estimated cost or amount allotted to a contract be used for the sole purpose of funding termination or other specified expenses.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Government personnel encouraging a contractor to continue work in the absence of funds (31 U.S.C. 1341 <em class="ph i">et seq.)</em> may subject the violator to civil or criminal penalties.</p></div>
