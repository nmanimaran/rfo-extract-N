It is the difference between that which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating time on a one-shift basis, less operating interruptions resulting from time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other normal delays, and the extent to which the facility was actually used to meet demands during the accounting period. A multiple-shift basis may be used in the calculation instead of a one-shift basis if it can be shown that this amount of usage could normally be expected for the type of facility involved.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_205_17__d1972e31"><em class="ph i _31.205-17d1973e49 Term">Idle facilities</em> means completely unused facilities that are excess to the contractor’s current needs.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_205_17__d1972e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> The costs of idle facilities are unallowable unless the facilities—</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_205_17__d1972e42"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Are necessary to meet fluctuations in workload; or</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_31_205_17__d1972e47"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in requirements, production economies, reorganization, termination, or other causes that could not have been reasonably foreseen. (Costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period, ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending upon the initiative taken to use, lease, or dispose of the idle facilities (except see 31.205-42)).</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_205_17__d1972e55"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Costs of idle capacity are costs of doing business and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or overhead rates from period to period. Such costs are allowable when the capacity is necessary or was originally reasonable and is not subject to reduction or elimination by subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business, economics, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an entire plant or among a group of assets having substantially the same function may be idle facilities.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_31_205_17__d1972e60"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Any costs to be paid directly by the Government for idle facilities, or idle capacity reserved for defense mobilization production must be the subject of a separate agreement (see 31.110(b)(9)).</p></div>
