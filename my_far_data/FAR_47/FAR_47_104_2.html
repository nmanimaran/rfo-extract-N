The contracting officer may occasionally require the contractor to prepay the freight charges to a specific destination. In such cases, the contractor must use a commercial bill of lading, and the contractor must invoice the direct and actual transportation cost as a separate item. The clause at 52.247-1, Commercial Bill of Lading Notations, ensures that the Government in this type of arrangement obtains the benefit of 49 U.S.C. 10721 and 13712 rates.</p></div>
