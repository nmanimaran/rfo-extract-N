<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>If a U.S.-flag air carrier cannot provide the international air transportation needed or if use of U.S.-flag air carrier service would not accomplish an agency’s mission, the agency may use a foreign-flag air carrier service as necessary.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> <span class="ph" id="FAR_47_403_1___Hlk207114905">Consider a </span>U.S.-flag air carrier service as available even though—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> A foreign-flag air carrier can provide comparable or a different kind of service at less cost;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The agency or traveler prefers, or finds convenient, foreign-flag air carrier service; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Excess foreign currency is available to pay for foreign-flag air carrier service (unless U.S.-flag air carriers decline to accept excess or near excess foreign currencies for transportation payable only out of such monies).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Except as provided in paragraph (a), use U.S.-flag air carrier service for U.S. Government-financed commercial foreign air travel if U.S.-flag air carrier service is available. In determining availability of a U.S.-flag air carrier, apply the following scheduling principles unless their application would result in the last or first leg of travel to or from the United States being performed by a foreign-flag air carrier:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Use U.S.-flag air carrier service available at point of origin to destination or, in the absence of direct or through service, to the farthest interchange point on a usually traveled route.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> When a U.S.-flag air carrier does not serve an origin or interchange point, use foreign-flag air carrier service only to the nearest interchange point on a usually traveled route to connect with U.S.-flag air carrier service.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> When a U.S.-flag air carrier involuntarily reroutes the traveler via a foreign-flag air carrier, the traveler may use the foreign-flag air carrier notwithstanding the availability of alternative U.S.-flag air carrier service.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> For travel between a gateway airport in the United States and a gateway airport abroad, consider passenger service by U.S.-flag air carrier unavailable if—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The gateway airport abroad is the traveler’s origin or destination airport, and use of U.S.-flag air carrier service would extend the time in a travel status, including delay at origin and accelerated arrival at destination, by at least 24 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier; or</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span></p><p class="RuninChild ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(i)</span> The gateway airport abroad is an interchange point and use of U.S.-flag air carrier service would require the traveler to wait 6 hours or more to make connections at that point; or</p><p class="ListL3"><span class="ph autonumber">(ii)</span> Delayed departure from, or accelerated arrival at, the gateway airport in the United States would extend time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> The rules in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) apply to travel between two points outside the United States, but do not consider passenger service by a U.S.-flag air carrier reasonably available if—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Travel by a foreign-flag air carrier would eliminate two or more aircraft changes en route;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> One of the two points abroad is the gateway airport en route to or from the United States and the use of a U.S.-flag air carrier would extend the time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier, including accelerated arrival at the overseas destination or delayed departure from the overseas origin, as well as delay at the gateway airport or other interchange point abroad; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The travel is not part of the trip to or from the United States and the use of a U.S.-flag air carrier would extend the time in a travel status by at least 6 hours more than travel by a foreign-flag air carrier including delay at origin, delay en route, and accelerated arrival at destination.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> For all short-distance travel under either paragraph (d) or paragraph (e), do not consider U.S. air carrier service available when the elapsed travel time on a scheduled flight from origin to destination airport by foreign-flag air carrier is 3 hours or less and service by a U.S.-flag air carrier would involve at least 6 hours of travel time.</p></div>
