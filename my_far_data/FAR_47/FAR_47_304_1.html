<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>In general, determine f.o.b. terms based on overall costs, considering the criteria in this section.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> Specify in solicitations whether offerors must submit offers f.o.b. origin, f.o.b. destination, or both, or whether offerors may choose the basis on which they make an offer. Consider the most advantageous delivery point, such as—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> F.o.b. origin, carrier’s equipment, wharf, or specified freight station near contractor’s plant; or</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> F.o.b. destination.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> In determining whether f.o.b. origin or f.o.b. destination is more advantageous to the Government, consider the availability of lower freight rates, i.e., Government rate tenders, to the Government for f.o.b. origin acquisitions. F.o.b. origin contracts also present other desirable traffic management features, in that they—</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Permit use of transit privileges (see 47.305-13);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Permit diversions to new destinations without price adjustment for transportation (see 47.305-11);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Facilitate use of special routings or types of equipment (e.g., circuitous routing or oversize shipments) (see 47.305-14);</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Facilitate, if necessary, use of premium cost transportation and permit Government-controlled transportation;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Permit negotiations for reduced freight rates (see 47.104-1(b)); and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> Permit use of small shipment consolidation stations.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> When destinations are tentative or unknown, specify in the solicitation f.o.b. origin only.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> When the size or quantity of supplies with confidential or higher security classification requires commercial transportation services, generally specify f.o.b. origin acquisitions.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> When acceptance must be at destination, specify in the solicitation f.o.b. destination only.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(g)</span> Here follow examples of situations in which solicitations will normally be on an f.o.b. destination only basis as advantageous to the Government (see 47.305-4):</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Bulk supplies, such as coal, that require other than Government-owned or operated handling, storage, and loading facilities, are destined for shipment outside CONUS.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Steel or other bulk construction products are destined for shipment outside CONUS.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Supplies consist of forest products such as lumber.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Perishable or medical supplies are subject to in-transit deterioration.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Evaluation of f.o.b. origin offers will likely result in increased administrative lead time or administrative cost that would outweigh the potential advantages of an f.o.b. origin determination.</p></div>
