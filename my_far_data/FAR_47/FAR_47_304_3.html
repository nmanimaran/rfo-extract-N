This policy applies to supplies and equipment shipped either directly to a port area for export or to a storage or holding area for subsequent forwarding to a port area for export.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Solicitation of offers on other than an f.o.b. origin basis requires written justification.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Export cargo involves considerations of operational and cost factors from the point of origin within CONUS to the overseas port destination. Determine the lowest cost of shipping only upon considering and comparing the various prospective landed costs, including inland, terminal, and ocean costs. Also, agencies may have export licensing privileges for shipments to foreign destinations. Obtain advice from the transportation officer to ensure full use of these privileges.</p></div>
