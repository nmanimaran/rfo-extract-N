                <h2>42.601Notice of intent to disallow costs.</h2>
<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> Contracting officers must make reasonable efforts to proactively address potentially unallowable costs with contractors. If unable to settle the matter through discussion, the cognizant contracting officer responsible for administering the contract may issue the contractor a written notice of intent to disallow specified costs incurred or planned for incurrence during the performance of the following contract types:</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Cost-reimbursement contracts.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Cost-reimbursement portions of fixed-price contracts.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Letter contracts that provides for reimbursement of costs.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Time-and-material and labor-hour contracts.</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Fixed-price incentive contracts.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> A notice of intent to disallow such costs usually results from monitoring contractor costs. The purpose of the notice is to notify the contractor as early as practicable during contract performance that the cost is considered unallowable under the contract terms and to provide for timely resolution of any resulting disagreement. In case of disagreement, the contractor may submit to the contracting officer a written response. Any such response must be answered by withdrawal of the notice or by making a written decision within 60 days.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> As a minimum, the notice must-</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Refer to the contract’s Notice of Intent to Disallow Costs clause;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> State the contractor’s name and list the numbers of the affected contracts;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> Describe the costs to be disallowed, including estimated dollar value by item and applicable time periods, and state the reasons for the intended disallowance;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Describe the potential impact on billing rates and forward pricing rate agreements;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> State the notice’s effective date and the date by which written response must be received;</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> List the recipients of copies of the notice; and</p><p class="ListL2"><span class="ph autonumber">(7)</span> Request the contractor to acknowledge receipt of the notice.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> The contracting officer issuing the notice must furnish copies to all contracting officers cognizant of any segment of the contractor’s organization.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> If the notice involves elements of indirect cost, it must not be issued without coordination with the contracting officer or auditor having authority for final indirect cost settlement (see 42.505).</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(f)</span> In the event the contractor submits a response that disagrees with the notice (see paragraph (b) of this section), the contracting officer who issued the notice must either withdraw the notice or issue the written decision, except when elements of indirect cost are involved, in which case the contracting officer responsible under 42.505 for determining final indirect cost rates must issue the decision.</p></div>
