<div class="body conbody"><p class="p">When a negotiated CAS price adjustment or a determination of noncompliance is required at the subcontract level, the CFAO for the subcontractor must furnish a copy of the negotiation memorandum or the determination to the CFAO for the contractor of the next higher-tier subcontractor. The CFAO of the contractor or the next higher-tier subcontractor is not permitted to change such negotiation memorandum or determination. If the subcontractor refuses to submit a GDM or DCI proposal, contract remedies are made at the prime contractor level.</p></div>
