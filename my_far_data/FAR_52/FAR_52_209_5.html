The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

However, the Government will consider the certification in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_209_5__d3126e178"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> This provision does not require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a).
