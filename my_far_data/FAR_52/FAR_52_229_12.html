The excise tax withholding is applied at the payment level, not at the contract level. The Contractor should revise each IRS Form W-14 submission to reflect the exemption (if any) that applies to that particular invoice, such as a different exemption applying. In the absence of a completed IRS Form W-14 accompanying a payment request, the default withholding percentage is 2 percent for the section 5000C withholding for that payment request.

If the Contractor marks box 9 of the IRS Form W-14 (rather than completes Lines 10 through 12), the Contractor must identify and enter the specific exempt and nonexempt amounts in Line 15 of the IRS Form W-14; the Government will then withhold 2 percent only from the nonexempt amount.
