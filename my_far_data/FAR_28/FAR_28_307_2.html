Contractors are required to comply with applicable Federal and State workers’ compensation and occupational disease statutes. If occupational diseases are not compensable under those statutes, they must be covered under the employer’s liability section of the insurance policy, except when contract operations are so commingled with a contractor’s commercial operations that it would not be practical to require this coverage. Employer’s liability coverage of at least $100,000 must be required, except in States with exclusive or monopolistic funds that do not permit workers’ compensation to be written by private carriers. (See 28.305(c) for treatment of contracts subject to the Defense Base Act.)</p><p class="Runin RuninRestart ListL1" id="FAR_28_307_2__d1853e20"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> General liability.</p><p class="RuninChild ListL2" id="FAR_28_307_2__d1853e26"><span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The contracting officer must require bodily injury liability insurance coverage written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $500,000 per occurrence.</p><p class="ListL2" id="FAR_28_307_2__d1853e31"><span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Property damage liability insurance must be required only in special circumstances as determined by the agency.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_307_2__d1853e36"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> <em class="ph i">Automobile liability</em>. The contracting officer must require automobile liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy. The policy must provide for bodily injury and property damage liability covering the operation of all automobiles used in connection with performing the contract. Policies covering automobiles operated in the United States must provide coverage of at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury and $20,000 per occurrence for property damage. The amount of liability coverage on other policies must be commensurate with any legal requirements of the locality and sufficient to meet normal and customary claims.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_307_2__d1853e43"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> <em class="ph i">Aircraft public and passenger liability</em>.

Coverage must be at least $200,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence for bodily injury, other than passenger liability, and $200,000 per occurrence for property damage. Coverage for passenger liability bodily injury must be at least $200,000 multiplied by the number of seats or passengers, whichever is greater.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_28_307_2__d1853e50"><span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span> <em class="ph i">Vessel liability</em>.
