<div class="body conbody"><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_302__d1876e10"><span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span> The Government does not normally designate prime contractors and subcontractors as agents of the Government for claiming immunity from State or local sales or use taxes. Before any activity claims that a contractor is a Government agent, refer the matter to the agency head for review. Include all relevant data and a thorough analysis of all relevant legal precedents with the referral.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_302__d1876e15"><span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span> When purchases are made by a prime contractor or subcontractor rather than directly by the Government, the right to exemption from sales or use tax may not depend on the Government's immunity from direct taxation by States and localities. Instead, it may depend on provisions of the specific State or local law, or in some cases, the transaction may not be expressly exempt from the tax. Protect the Government's interest by following the procedures in 29.101.</p><p class="ListL1" id="FAR_29_302__d1876e23"><span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span> Often, property owned by the Government (including property acquired under progress payments or the Government property clause) is in a contractor's or subcontractor's possession. States or localities may claim the right to tax Government property directly or to tax the contractor's or subcontractor's possession of, interest in, or use of that property. In such cases, the contracting officer must seek review and advice from the agency's legal counsel on the appropriate action.</p><p class="ListL1"><span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span> Indefinite-delivery contracts for equipment rental may require the contractor to provide equipment in any state. States and local governments impose various taxes on equipment leased to the Government, and the tax amounts can vary significantly among jurisdictions.</p></div>
