<p class="p List2"> (3) Transferred between divisions, subsidiaries, or affiliates of the contractor under a common control.</p>

<p class="p List1">(b) <em class="ph i">Inspection/Acceptance</em>. </p>
<p class="p List2"> (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract at all places and times before acceptance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.</p>

<p class="p List2"> (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier.</p>

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the “hourly rate” attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. <em class="ph i">[Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.]</em>
</p>
<p class="p List2"> (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may—</p>

<p class="p List3"> (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor’s managerial personnel; or</p>
<p class="p List3"> (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor’s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor’s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified.</p>

<p class="p List4"> (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

<p class="p List4"> (C) Invoices may be submitted once each month (or at more frequent intervals, if approved by the Contracting Officer) to the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative.</p>
<p class="p List4"> (D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract.</p>
<p class="p List4"> (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">1</em>) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated.</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">2</em>) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract.</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">3</em>) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p class="p List3"> (ii) <em class="ph i">Materials</em>.</p>
<p class="p List4"> (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial product at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor’s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the—</p>

<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">2</em>) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements.</p>
<p class="p List4"> (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor—</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">1</em>) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">2</em>) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor’s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice.</p>
<p class="p List4"> (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall—</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">1</em>) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and</p>

<p class="p List4"> (D) Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed.</p>
<p class="p List5"> (<em class="ph i">1</em>) <em class="ph i">Other direct costs</em>. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: <em class="ph i">[Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert “None” if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided.

</p>
<p class="p List2"> (2) <em class="ph i">Total cost</em>. The total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule. The Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.</p>
<p class="p List2"> (3) <em class="ph i">Ceiling price</em>.

The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government will pay any such increases within 30 days, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor’s payment will be made by check.

<p class="p List4"> (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor.</p>
<p class="p List3"> (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in FAR part 32 in effect on the date of this contract.</p>
<p class="p List3"> (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the “completion invoice” and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise.

<p class="p List2"> (7) <em class="ph i">Release of claims</em>. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions:</p>
<p class="p List3"> (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor.</p>
<p class="p List3"> (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="p List3"> (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents.</p>
<p class="p List2"> (9) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made.</p>
<p class="p List2"> (8) <em class="ph i">Prompt payment</em>. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315.</p>
<p class="p List1">(l) <em class="ph i">Termination for the Government’s convenience</em>. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work under this contract and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor’s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="p List1">(m) <em class="ph i">Termination for cause</em>. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon written request, with adequate assurances of future performance. The Government will send a cure notice to the Contractor, unless the reason for the termination is late delivery. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount computed under paragraph (i), Payments, of this clause, but the “hourly rate” for labor hours expended in furnishing work not delivered to or accepted by the Government shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this clause, the portion of the “hourly rate” attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. In the event of termination for cause, the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.</p>
