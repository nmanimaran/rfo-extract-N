Contractor is a foreign person and has only a partial or no exemption
to the withholding, the Contractor shall include the Department
of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service Form W-14, Certificate
of Foreign Contracting Party Receiving Federal Procurement Payments,
with each voucher or invoice submitted under this contract throughout the
period in which this status is applicable. The excise tax withholding
is applied at the payment level, not at the contract level. The
Contractor should revise each IRS Form W-14 submission to reflect
the exemption (if any) that applies to that particular invoice,
such as a different exemption applying. In the absence of a completed
IRS Form W-14 accompanying a payment request, the default withholding
percentage is 2 percent for the section 5000C withholding for that payment
request. Information about IRS Form W-14 and its separate instructions
is available via the internet at <a class="xref" href="https://www.irs.gov/w14" target="_blank">www.irs.gov/w14</a>.</p>

will withhold a full 2 percent of each payment unless the Contractor
claims an exemption. If the Contractor enters a ratio in Line 12
of the IRS Form W-14, the result of Line 11 divided by Line 10,
the Government will withhold from each payment an amount equal to
2 percent multiplied by the contract ratio. If the Contractor marks
box 9 of the IRS Form W-14 (rather than completes Lines 10 through
12), the Contractor must
identify and enter the specific exempt and nonexempt amounts
in Line 15 of the IRS Form W-14; the Government will then withhold
2 percent only from the nonexempt amount. See the IRS Form W-14
and its instructions.</p>
