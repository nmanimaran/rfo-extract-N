<span class="ph autonumber">(a)</span>
<em class="ph i">Submission of offers</em>. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. As a minimum, offers shall include—</p>
<p class="ListL2" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e27">
<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The solicitation number;</p>
<p class="ListL2" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e32">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The name, address, telephone number of the Offeror;</p>
<p class="ListL2" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e37">

<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Information necessary to evaluate the factors contained in the provision at 52.212-2 or as described in the solicitation;</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> Responses to provisions that require Offeror completion of information, representations, and certifications (other than those collected via the System for Award Management (SAM)); and</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(6)</span> A statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation and any solicitation amendments.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e42">
<span class="ph autonumber">(b)</span>
<em class="ph i">Period for acceptance of offers</em>. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 60 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e117">
<span class="ph autonumber">(c)</span>
<em class="ph i">Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers</em>.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> Offerors are responsible for submitting offers and any modifications or revisions to the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> Any offer, modification, or revision received after the time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made and the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition. However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> Offerors may withdraw their offers by written notice to the Government received at any time before award.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e124">
<span class="ph autonumber">(d)</span>
<em class="ph i">Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids)</em>. The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror’s initial offer should contain the Offeror’s best terms. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions, if necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest, accept other than the lowest offer, and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.</p>
<p class="ListL1" id="FAR_52_212_1__d3158e131">
<span class="ph autonumber">(e)</span>

<span class="ph autonumber">(1)</span> The agency’s evaluation of the significant weak or deficient factors in the debriefed Offeror’s offer.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(2)</span> The overall evaluated cost or price and technical rating of the successful Offeror and the debriefed Offeror and past performance information on the debriefed Offeror.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(3)</span> The overall ranking of all Offerors when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(4)</span> A summary of the rationale for award.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
<span class="ph autonumber">(5)</span> For acquisitions of commercial products, the make and model of the product to be delivered by the successful Offeror.</p>
<p class="ListL2">
